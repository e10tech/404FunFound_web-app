",この物語は、アリスという名の少女が、川辺で座っているときに退屈で眠くなり、白ウサギに出会ってウサギの穴からウサギを追いかけ、不思議な生き物と気まぐれな冒険に満ちた空想の世界に飛び込むというものである,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/images/cover.jpg,Down the Rabbit-Hole,"Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank, andof having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sisterwas reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, “and what isthe use of a book,” thought Alice “without pictures orconversations?”So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the hot daymade her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of making adaisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies,when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.There was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it sovery much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Ohdear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards, itoccurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it allseemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually took a watch out of itswaistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started toher feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen arabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, andburning with curiosity, she ran across the field after it, and fortunately wasjust in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in theworld she was to get out again.The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dippedsuddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stoppingherself before she found herself falling down a very deep well.Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had plenty oftime as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happennext. First, she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to, but itwas too dark to see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, andnoticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and thereshe saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of theshelves as she passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but toher great disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar forfear of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of thecupboards as she fell past it.“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this,I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll allthink me at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I felloff the top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)Down, down, down. Would the fall never come to an end? “I wonderhow many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “Imust be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that wouldbe four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice hadlearnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and thoughthis was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge, asthere was no one to listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over)“—yes, that’s about the right distance—but then Iwonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no ideawhat Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand wordsto say.)Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right throughthe earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walkwith their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she wasrather glad there was no one listening, this time, as it didn’tsound at all the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them whatthe name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma’am, is this New Zealandor Australia?” (and she tried to curtsey as she spoke—fancycurtseying as you’re falling through the air! Do you think youcould manage it?) “And what an ignorant little girl she’ll think mefor asking! No, it’ll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written upsomewhere.”Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talkingagain. “Dinah’ll miss me very much to-night, I should think!”(Dinah was the cat.) “I hope they’ll remember her saucer of milk attea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me! There are no micein the air, I’m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that’s verylike a mouse, you know. But do cats eat bats, I wonder?” And here Alicebegan to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort ofway, “Do cats eat bats? Do cats eat bats?” and sometimes, “Dobats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer eitherquestion, it didn’t much matter which way she put it. She felt that shewas dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in handwith Dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, “Now, Dinah, tell me thetruth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly, thump! thump! down shecame upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment: shelooked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another long passage,and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it. There was not amoment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hearit say, as it turned a corner, “Oh my ears and whiskers, how lateit’s getting!” She was close behind it when she turned the corner,but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found herself in a long, low hall,which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alicehad been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, shewalked sadly down the middle, wondering how she was ever to get out again.Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass;there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s firstthought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate itwould not open any of them. However, on the second time round, she came upon alow curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door aboutfifteen inches high: she tried the little golden key in the lock, and to hergreat delight it fitted!Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not muchlarger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the passage into theloveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get out of that dark hall, andwander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, butshe could not even get her head through the doorway; “and even if my headwould go through,” thought poor Alice, “it would be of very littleuse without my shoulders. Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! Ithink I could, if I only knew how to begin.” For, you see, so manyout-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think thatvery few things indeed were really impossible.There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went back tothe table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at any rate a bookof rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she found a littlebottle on it, (“which certainly was not here before,” said Alice,)and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words “DRINKME,” beautifully printed on it in large letters.It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alicewas not going to do that in a hurry. “No, I’ll lookfirst,” she said, “and see whether it’s marked‘poison’ or not”; for she had read several nice littlehistories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts andother unpleasant things, all because they would not remember the simplerules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burnyou if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger very deeplywith a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had never forgotten that, if you drinkmuch from a bottle marked “poison,” it is almost certain todisagree with you, sooner or later.However, this bottle was not marked “poison,” so Aliceventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort ofmixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, andhot buttered toast,) she very soon finished it off.     “What a curious feeling!” said Alice; “I must be shutting uplike a telescope.”And so it was indeed: she was now only ten inches high, and her face brightenedup at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the littledoor into that lovely garden. First, however, she waited for a few minutes tosee if she was going to shrink any further: she felt a little nervous aboutthis; “for it might end, you know,” said Alice to herself,“in my going out altogether, like a candle. I wonder what I should belike then?” And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is likeafter the candle is blown out, for she could not remember ever having seen sucha thing.After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided on going intothe garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice! when she got to the door, shefound she had forgotten the little golden key, and when she went back to thetable for it, she found she could not possibly reach it: she could see it quiteplainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb up one of the legsof the table, but it was too slippery; and when she had tired herself out withtrying, the poor little thing sat down and cried.“Come, there’s no use in crying like that!” said Alice toherself, rather sharply; “I advise you to leave off this minute!”She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very seldom followedit), and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into hereyes; and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheatedherself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curiouschild was very fond of pretending to be two people. “But it’s nouse now,” thought poor Alice, “to pretend to be two people! Why,there’s hardly enough of me left to make one respectableperson!”Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: sheopened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words “EATME” were beautifully marked in currants. “Well, I’ll eatit,” said Alice, “and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach thekey; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either wayI’ll get into the garden, and I don’t care which happens!”She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, “Which way? Whichway?”, holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it wasgrowing, and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size:to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got somuch into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

Good-bye,feet!” (for when she looked down at her feet, they seemed to be almostout of sight, they were getting so far off). “Oh, my poor little feet, Iwonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears? I’msure I shan’t be able! I shall be a great deal too far off totrouble myself about you: you must manage the best way you can;—but Imust be kind to them,” thought Alice, “or perhaps they won’twalk the way I want to go! Let me see: I’ll give them a new pair of bootsevery Christmas.”And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it. “They mustgo by the carrier,” she thought; “and how funny it’ll seem,sending presents to one’s own feet! And how odd the directions will look!Oh dear, what nonsense I’m talking!”Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she was nowmore than nine feet high, and she at once took up the little golden key andhurried off to the garden door.Poor Alice! It was as much as she could do, lying down on one side, to lookthrough into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless thanever: she sat down and began to cry again.“You ought to be ashamed of yourself,” said Alice, “a greatgirl like you,” (she might well say this), “to go on crying in thisway! Stop this moment, I tell you!” But she went on all the same,shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her, aboutfour inches deep and reaching half down the hall.After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and shehastily dried her eyes to see what was coming. It was the White Rabbitreturning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand anda large fan in the other: he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering tohimself as he came, “Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won’t she besavage if I’ve kept her waiting!” Alice felt so desperate that shewas ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her, she began,in a low, timid voice, “If you please, sir—” The Rabbitstarted violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried awayinto the darkness as hard as he could go.Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she keptfanning herself all the time she went on talking: “Dear, dear! How queereverything is to-day! And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder ifI’ve been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I gotup this morning? I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. Butif I’m not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I? Ah,that’s the great puzzle!” And she began thinking over allthe children she knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she couldhave been changed for any of them.“I’m sure I’m not Ada,” she said, “for her hairgoes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn’t go in ringlets at all; andI’m sure I can’t be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,oh! she knows such a very little! Besides, she’s she, andI’m I, and—oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I’ll tryif I know all the things I used to know. Let me see: four times five is twelve,and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is—oh dear! I shallnever get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Tabledoesn’t signify: let’s try Geography. London is the capital ofParis, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome—no, that’sall wrong, I’m certain! I must have been changed for Mabel! I’lltry and say ‘How doth the little—’” and shecrossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons, and began to repeatit, but her voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come thesame as they used to do:—“How doth the little crocodileImprove his shining tail,And pour the waters of the NileOn every golden scale!“How cheerfully he seems to grin,How neatly spread his claws,And welcome little fishes inWith gently smiling jaws!”“I’m sure those are not the right words,” said poor Alice,and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, “I must be Mabelafter all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and havenext to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn! No,I’ve made up my mind about it; if I’m Mabel, I’ll stay downhere! It’ll be no use their putting their heads down and saying‘Come up again, dear!’ I shall only look up and say ‘Who am Ithen? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I’llcome up: if not, I’ll stay down here till I’m somebodyelse’—but, oh dear!” cried Alice, with a sudden burst oftears, “I do wish they would put their heads down! I am sovery tired of being all alone here!”As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was surprised to see thatshe had put on one of the Rabbit’s little white kid gloves while she wastalking. “How can I have done that?” she thought. “Imust be growing small again.” She got up and went to the table to measureherself by it, and found that, as nearly as she could guess, she was now abouttwo feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly: she soon found out that thecause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it hastily, just intime to avoid shrinking away altogether.“That was a narrow escape!” said Alice, a good dealfrightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still inexistence; “and now for the garden!” and she ran with all speedback to the little door: but, alas! the little door was shut again, and thelittle golden key was lying on the glass table as before, “and things areworse than ever,” thought the poor child, “for I never was so smallas this before, never! And I declare it’s too bad, that it is!”As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! shewas up to her chin in salt water. Her first idea was that she had somehowfallen into the sea, “and in that case I can go back by railway,”she said to herself. (Alice had been to the seaside once in her life, and hadcome to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coastyou find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in thesand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them arailway station.) However, she soon made out that she was in the pool of tearswhich she had wept when she was nine feet high.“I wish I hadn’t cried so much!” said Alice, as she swamabout, trying to find her way out. “I shall be punished for it now, Isuppose, by being drowned in my own tears! That will be a queer thing,to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.”Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, andshe swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought it must be awalrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small she was now, and shesoon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.“Would it be of any use, now,” thought Alice, “to speak tothis mouse? Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think verylikely it can talk: at any rate, there’s no harm in trying.” So shebegan: “O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired ofswimming about here, O Mouse!” (Alice thought this must be the right wayof speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but sheremembered having seen in her brother’s Latin Grammar, “Amouse—of a mouse—to a mouse—a mouse—O mouse!”)The Mouse looked at her rather inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink withone of its little eyes, but it said nothing.“Perhaps it doesn’t understand English,” thought Alice;“I daresay it’s a French mouse, come over with William theConqueror.” (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had no veryclear notion how long ago anything had happened.) So she began again: “Oùest ma chatte?” which was the first sentence in her French lesson-book.The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all overwith fright. “Oh, I beg your pardon!” cried Alice hastily, afraidthat she had hurt the poor animal’s feelings. “I quite forgot youdidn’t like cats.”“Not like cats!” cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice.“Would you like cats if you were me?”“Well, perhaps not,” said Alice in a soothing tone:“don’t be angry about it. And yet I wish I could show you our catDinah: I think you’d take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. Sheis such a dear quiet thing,” Alice went on, half to herself, as she swamlazily about in the pool, “and she sits purring so nicely by the fire,licking her paws and washing her face—and she is such a nice soft thingto nurse—and she’s such a capital one for catching mice—oh, Ibeg your pardon!” cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse wasbristling all over, and she felt certain it must be really offended. “Wewon’t talk about her any more if you’d rather not.”“We indeed!” cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end ofhis tail. “As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family alwayshated cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don’t let me hear the nameagain!”“I won’t indeed!” said Alice, in a great hurry to change thesubject of conversation. “Are you—are you fond—of—ofdogs?” The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: “Thereis such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you! A littlebright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! Andit’ll fetch things when you throw them, and it’ll sit up and begfor its dinner, and all sorts of things—I can’t remember half ofthem—and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he says it’s souseful, it’s worth a hundred pounds! He says it kills all the ratsand—oh dear!” cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, “I’mafraid I’ve offended it again!” For the Mouse was swimming awayfrom her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as itwent.So she called softly after it, “Mouse dear! Do come back again, and wewon’t talk about cats or dogs either, if you don’t likethem!” When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back toher: its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), and it said in alow trembling voice, “Let us get to the shore, and then I’ll tellyou my history, and you’ll understand why it is I hate cats anddogs.”It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birdsand animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory andan Eaglet, and several other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and thewhole party swam to the shore."

I’ll soon makeyou dry enough!” They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with theMouse in the middle. Alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she feltsure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.“Ahem!” said the Mouse with an important air, “are you allready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please!‘William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soonsubmitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late muchaccustomed to usurpation and conquest. Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Merciaand Northumbria—’”“Ugh!” said the Lory, with a shiver.“I beg your pardon!” said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely:“Did you speak?”“Not I!” said the Lory hastily.“I thought you did,” said the Mouse. “—I proceed.‘Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found itadvisable—’”“Found what?” said the Duck.“Found it,” the Mouse replied rather crossly: “ofcourse you know what ‘it’ means.”“I know what ‘it’ means well enough, when I find athing,” said the Duck: “it’s generally a frog or a worm. Thequestion is, what did the archbishop find?”The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,“‘—found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meetWilliam and offer him the crown. William’s conduct at first was moderate.But the insolence of his Normans—’ How are you getting on now, mydear?” it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke.“As wet as ever,” said Alice in a melancholy tone: “itdoesn’t seem to dry me at all.”“In that case,” said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet,“I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of moreenergetic remedies—”“Speak English!” said the Eaglet. “I don’t know themeaning of half those long words, and, what’s more, I don’t believeyou do either!” And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: someof the other birds tittered audibly.“What I was going to say,” said the Dodo in an offended tone,“was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.”“What is a Caucus-race?” said Alice; not that she wantedmuch to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that somebodyought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.“Why,” said the Dodo, “the best way to explain it is to doit.” (And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day,I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (“the exact shapedoesn’t matter,” it said,) and then all the party were placed alongthe course, here and there. There was no “One, two, three, andaway,” but they began running when they liked, and left off when theyliked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over. However, whenthey had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodosuddenly called out “The race is over!” and they all crowded roundit, panting, and asking, “But who has won?”This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and itsat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead (the position inwhich you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him), while the restwaited in silence. At last the Dodo said, “Everybody has won, andall must have prizes.”“But who is to give the prizes?” quite a chorus of voices asked.“Why, she, of course,” said the Dodo, pointing to Alice withone finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in aconfused way, “Prizes! Prizes!”Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her pocket,and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it),and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece, all round.“But she must have a prize herself, you know,” said the Mouse.“Of course,” the Dodo replied very gravely. “What else haveyou got in your pocket?” he went on, turning to Alice.“Only a thimble,” said Alice sadly.“Hand it over here,” said the Dodo.Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo solemnly presentedthe thimble, saying “We beg your acceptance of this elegantthimble;” and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave thatshe did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything to say, shesimply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she could.The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, asthe large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small oneschoked and had to be patted on the back. However, it was over at last, and theysat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.“You promised to tell me your history, you know,” said Alice,“and why it is you hate—C and D,” she added in a whisper,half afraid that it would be offended again.“Mine is a long and a sad tale!” said the Mouse, turning to Alice,and sighing.“It is a long tail, certainly,” said Alice, looking downwith wonder at the Mouse’s tail; “but why do you call itsad?” And she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, sothat her idea of the tale was something like this:—“You are not attending!” said the Mouse to Alice severely.“What are you thinking of?”“I beg your pardon,” said Alice very humbly: “you had got tothe fifth bend, I think?”“I had not!” cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.“A knot!” said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, andlooking anxiously about her. “Oh, do let me help to undo it!”“I shall do nothing of the sort,” said the Mouse, getting up andwalking away. “You insult me by talking such nonsense!”“I didn’t mean it!” pleaded poor Alice. “Butyou’re so easily offended, you know!”The Mouse only growled in reply.“Please come back and finish your story!” Alice called after it;and the others all joined in chorus, “Yes, please do!” but theMouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.“What a pity it wouldn’t stay!” sighed the Lory, as soon asit was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying toher daughter “Ah, my dear! Let this be a lesson to you never to loseyour temper!” “Hold your tongue, Ma!” said the youngCrab, a little snappishly. “You’re enough to try the patience of anoyster!”“I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!” said Alice aloud,addressing nobody in particular. “She’d soon fetch it back!”“And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?” saidthe Lory.Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about her pet:“Dinah’s our cat. And she’s such a capital one for catchingmice you can’t think! And oh, I wish you could see her after the birds!Why, she’ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!”This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party. Some of the birdshurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully,remarking, “I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn’tsuit my throat!” and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to itschildren, “Come away, my dears! It’s high time you were all inbed!” On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon leftalone.“I wish I hadn’t mentioned Dinah!” she said to herself in amelancholy tone. “Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I’m sureshe’s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah! I wonder if I shallever see you any more!” And here poor Alice began to cry again, for shefelt very lonely and low-spirited. In a little while, however, she again hearda little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly,half hoping that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to finishhis story."

",この物語は、アリスという名の少女が、川辺で座っているときに退屈で眠くなり、白ウサギに出会ってウサギの穴からウサギを追いかけ、不思議な生き物と気まぐれな冒険に満ちた空想の世界に飛び込むというものである,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/images/cover.jpg,The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill,"It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiouslyabout as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard it muttering toitself “The Duchess! The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur andwhiskers! She’ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets! Wherecan I have dropped them, I wonder?” Alice guessed in a moment thatit was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she verygood-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to beseen—everything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool, andthe great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanishedcompletely.Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about, and called outto her in an angry tone, “Why, Mary Ann, what are you doing outhere? Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan! Quick,now!” And Alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in thedirection it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made.“He took me for his housemaid,” she said to herself as she ran.“How surprised he’ll be when he finds out who I am! But I’dbetter take him his fan and gloves—that is, if I can find them.” Asshe said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was abright brass plate with the name “W. RABBIT,” engraved upon it. Shewent in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she shouldmeet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found thefan and gloves.“How queer it seems,” Alice said to herself, “to be goingmessages for a rabbit! I suppose Dinah’ll be sending me on messagesnext!” And she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen:“‘Miss Alice! Come here directly, and get ready for yourwalk!’ ‘Coming in a minute, nurse! But I’ve got to see thatthe mouse doesn’t get out.’ Only I don’t think,” Alicewent on, “that they’d let Dinah stop in the house if it beganordering people about like that!”By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in thewindow, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs of tiny whitekid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going toleave the room, when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near thelooking-glass. There was no label this time with the words “DRINKME,” but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips. “Iknow something interesting is sure to happen,” she said toherself, “whenever I eat or drink anything; so I’ll just see whatthis bottle does. I do hope it’ll make me grow large again, for reallyI’m quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!”It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected: before she had drunkhalf the bottle, she found her head pressing against the ceiling, and had tostoop to save her neck from being broken. She hastily put down the bottle,saying to herself “That’s quite enough—I hope I shan’tgrow any more—As it is, I can’t get out at the door—I do wishI hadn’t drunk quite so much!”Alas! it was too late to wish that! She went on growing, and growing, and verysoon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even roomfor this, and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against thedoor, and the other arm curled round her head. Still she went on growing, and,as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one foot up thechimney, and said to herself “Now I can do no more, whatever happens.What will become of me?”Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and shegrew no larger: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be nosort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she feltunhappy.“It was much pleasanter at home,” thought poor Alice, “whenone wasn’t always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about bymice and rabbits. I almost wish I hadn’t gone down thatrabbit-hole—and yet—and yet—it’s rather curious, youknow, this sort of life! I do wonder what can have happened to me! WhenI used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, andnow here I am in the middle of one! There ought to be a book written about me,that there ought! And when I grow up, I’ll write one—but I’mgrown up now,” she added in a sorrowful tone; “at leastthere’s no room to grow up any more here.”“But then,” thought Alice, “shall I never get anyolder than I am now? That’ll be a comfort, one way—never to be anold woman—but then—always to have lessons to learn! Oh, Ishouldn’t like that!”“Oh, you foolish Alice!” she answered herself. “How can youlearn lessons in here? Why, there’s hardly room for you, and noroom at all for any lesson-books!”And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other, and making quitea conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she heard a voiceoutside, and stopped to listen.“Mary Ann! Mary Ann!” said the voice. “Fetch me my glovesthis moment!” Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Aliceknew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and she trembled till she shookthe house, quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large asthe Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as thedoor opened inwards, and Alice’s elbow was pressed hard against it, thatattempt proved a failure. Alice heard it say to itself “Then I’llgo round and get in at the window.”“That you won’t!” thought Alice, and, after waitingtill she fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenlyspread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air. She did not get hold ofanything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of brokenglass, from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into acucumber-frame, or something of the sort.Next came an angry voice—the Rabbit’s—“Pat! Pat! Whereare you?” And then a voice she had never heard before, “Sure thenI’m here! Digging for apples, yer honour!”“Digging for apples, indeed!” said the Rabbit angrily. “Here!Come and help me out of this!” (Sounds of more broken glass.)“Now tell me, Pat, what’s that in the window?”“Sure, it’s an arm, yer honour!” (He pronounced it“arrum.”)“An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the wholewindow!”“Sure, it does, yer honour: but it’s an arm for all that.”“Well, it’s got no business there, at any rate: go and take itaway!”There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now andthen; such as, “Sure, I don’t like it, yer honour, at all, atall!” “Do as I tell you, you coward!” and at last she spreadout her hand again, and made another snatch in the air. This time there weretwo little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. “What anumber of cucumber-frames there must be!” thought Alice. “I wonderwhat they’ll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wishthey could! I’m sure I don’t want to stay in here anylonger!”She waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumblingof little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together:she made out the words: “Where’s the other ladder?—Why, Ihadn’t to bring but one; Bill’s got the other—Bill! fetch ithere, lad!—Here, put ’em up at this corner—No, tie ’emtogether first—they don’t reach half high enough yet—Oh!they’ll do well enough; don’t be particular—Here, Bill! catchhold of this rope—Will the roof bear?—Mind that looseslate—Oh, it’s coming down! Heads below!” (a loudcrash)—“Now, who did that?—It was Bill, Ifancy—Who’s to go down the chimney?—Nay, Ishan’t! You do it!—That I won’t,then!—Bill’s to go down—Here, Bill! the master saysyou’re to go down the chimney!”“Oh! So Bill’s got to come down the chimney, has he?” saidAlice to herself. “Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill! Iwouldn’t be in Bill’s place for a good deal: this fireplace isnarrow, to be sure; but I think I can kick a little!”She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and waited till sheheard a little animal (she couldn’t guess of what sort it was) scratchingand scrambling about in the chimney close above her: then, saying to herself“This is Bill,” she gave one sharp kick, and waited to see whatwould happen next.The first thing she heard was a general chorus of “There goesBill!” then the Rabbit’s voice along—“Catch him, you bythe hedge!” then silence, and then another confusion ofvoices—“Hold up his head—Brandy now—Don’t chokehim—How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all aboutit!”Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (“That’s Bill,”thought Alice,) “Well, I hardly know—No more, thank ye; I’mbetter now—but I’m a deal too flustered to tell you—all Iknow is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like asky-rocket!”“So you did, old fellow!” said the others.“We must burn the house down!” said the Rabbit’s voice; andAlice called out as loud as she could, “If you do, I’ll set Dinahat you!”There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, “Iwonder what they will do next! If they had any sense, they’d takethe roof off.” After a minute or two, they began moving about again, andAlice heard the Rabbit say, “A barrowful will do, to begin with.”“A barrowful of what?” thought Alice; but she had not longto doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in atthe window, and some of them hit her in the face. “I’ll put a stopto this,” she said to herself, and shouted out, “You’d betternot do that again!” which produced another dead silence.Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into littlecakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her head. “IfI eat one of these cakes,” she thought, “it’s sure to makesome change in my size; and as it can’t possibly make me larger,it must make me smaller, I suppose.”So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she beganshrinking directly. As soon as she was small enough to get through the door,she ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birdswaiting outside. The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held upby two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle. They all madea rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she ran off as hard as she could,and soon found herself safe in a thick wood.“The first thing I’ve got to do,” said Alice to herself, asshe wandered about in the wood, “is to grow to my right size again; andthe second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden. I think that willbe the best plan.”It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged;the only difficulty was, that she had not the smallest idea how to set aboutit; and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharpbark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry.An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes, and feeblystretching out one paw, trying to touch her. “Poor little thing!”said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried hard to whistle to it; but she wasterribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, inwhich case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, and held itout to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet atonce, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe toworry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from beingrun over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy made anotherrush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it;then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse,and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistleagain; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running avery little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarselyall the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with itstongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; so she set offat once, and ran till she was quite tired and out of breath, and till thepuppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.“And yet what a dear little puppy it was!” said Alice, as she leantagainst a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves:“I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if—if I’donly been the right size to do it! Oh dear! I’d nearly forgotten thatI’ve got to grow up again! Let me see—how is it to bemanaged? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the greatquestion is, what?”The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all round her at theflowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see anything that looked likethe right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a largemushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; and when she hadlooked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to herthat she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom,and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar, that wassitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, andtaking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else."

Alice replied, rathershyly, “I—I hardly know, sir, just at present—at least I knowwho I was when I got up this morning, but I think I must have beenchanged several times since then.”“What do you mean by that?” said the Caterpillar sternly.“Explain yourself!”“I can’t explain myself, I’m afraid, sir,” saidAlice, “because I’m not myself, you see.”“I don’t see,” said the Caterpillar.“I’m afraid I can’t put it more clearly,” Alice repliedvery politely, “for I can’t understand it myself to begin with; andbeing so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.”“It isn’t,” said the Caterpillar.“Well, perhaps you haven’t found it so yet,” said Alice;“but when you have to turn into a chrysalis—you will some day, youknow—and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you’llfeel it a little queer, won’t you?”“Not a bit,” said the Caterpillar.“Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,” said Alice;“all I know is, it would feel very queer to me.”“You!” said the Caterpillar contemptuously. “Who areyou?”Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felta little irritated at the Caterpillar’s making such very shortremarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, “I think, youought to tell me who you are, first.”“Why?” said the Caterpillar.Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any goodreason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a very unpleasant stateof mind, she turned away.“Come back!” the Caterpillar called after her. “I’vesomething important to say!”This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.“Keep your temper,” said the Caterpillar.“Is that all?” said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as shecould.“No,” said the Caterpillar.Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, andperhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutesit puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took thehookah out of its mouth again, and said, “So you think you’rechanged, do you?”“I’m afraid I am, sir,” said Alice; “I can’tremember things as I used—and I don’t keep the same size for tenminutes together!”“Can’t remember what things?” said the Caterpillar.“Well, I’ve tried to say “How doth the little busybee,” but it all came different!” Alice replied in a verymelancholy voice.“Repeat, “You are old, Father William,’” saidthe Caterpillar.Alice folded her hands, and began:—“You are old, Father William,” the young man said,“And your hair has become very white;And yet you incessantly stand on your head—Do you think, at your age, it is right?”“In my youth,” Father William replied to his son,“I feared it might injure the brain;But, now that I’m perfectly sure I have none,Why, I do it again and again.”“You are old,” said the youth, “as I mentioned before,And have grown most uncommonly fat;Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door—Pray, what is the reason of that?”“In my youth,” said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,“I kept all my limbs very suppleBy the use of this ointment—one shilling the box—Allow me to sell you a couple?”“You are old,” said the youth, “and your jaws are too weakFor anything tougher than suet;Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak—Pray, how did you manage to do it?”“In my youth,” said his father, “I took to the law,And argued each case with my wife;And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,Has lasted the rest of my life.”“You are old,” said the youth, “one would hardly supposeThat your eye was as steady as ever;Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose—What made you so awfully clever?”“I have answered three questions, and that is enough,”Said his father; “don’t give yourself airs!Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?Be off, or I’ll kick you down stairs!”“That is not said right,” said the Caterpillar.“Not quite right, I’m afraid,” said Alice, timidly;“some of the words have got altered.”“It is wrong from beginning to end,” said the Caterpillardecidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.The Caterpillar was the first to speak.“What size do you want to be?” it asked.“Oh, I’m not particular as to size,” Alice hastily replied;“only one doesn’t like changing so often, you know.”“I don’t know,” said the Caterpillar.Alice said nothing: she had never been so much contradicted in her life before,and she felt that she was losing her temper.“Are you content now?” said the Caterpillar.“Well, I should like to be a little larger, sir, if youwouldn’t mind,” said Alice: “three inches is such a wretchedheight to be.”“It is a very good height indeed!” said the Caterpillar angrily,rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three inches high).“But I’m not used to it!” pleaded poor Alice in a piteoustone. And she thought of herself, “I wish the creatures wouldn’t beso easily offended!”“You’ll get used to it in time,” said the Caterpillar; and itput the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute ortwo the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice,and shook itself. Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in thegrass, merely remarking as it went, “One side will make you grow taller,and the other side will make you grow shorter.”“One side of what? The other side of what?” thoughtAlice to herself.“Of the mushroom,” said the Caterpillar, just as if she had askedit aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying tomake out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, shefound this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her armsround it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with eachhand.“And now which is which?” she said to herself, and nibbled a littleof the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violentblow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot!She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt thatthere was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to workat once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely againsther foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last,and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.     “Come, my head’s free at last!” said Alice in a tone ofdelight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that hershoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down,was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a seaof green leaves that lay far below her.“What can all that green stuff be?” said Alice. “Andwhere have my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it Ican’t see you?” She was moving them about as she spoke, but noresult seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant greenleaves.As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she triedto get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck wouldbend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded incurving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among theleaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which shehad been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a largepigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.“Serpent!” screamed the Pigeon.“I’m not a serpent!” said Alice indignantly.“Let me alone!”“Serpent, I say again!” repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subduedtone, and added with a kind of sob, “I’ve tried every way, andnothing seems to suit them!”“I haven’t the least idea what you’re talking about,”said Alice.“I’ve tried the roots of trees, and I’ve tried banks, andI’ve tried hedges,” the Pigeon went on, without attending to her;“but those serpents! There’s no pleasing them!”Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no use in sayinganything more till the Pigeon had finished.“As if it wasn’t trouble enough hatching the eggs,” said thePigeon; “but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day! Why, Ihaven’t had a wink of sleep these three weeks!”“I’m very sorry you’ve been annoyed,” said Alice, whowas beginning to see its meaning.“And just as I’d taken the highest tree in the wood,”continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, “and just as I wasthinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling downfrom the sky! Ugh, Serpent!”“But I’m not a serpent, I tell you!” said Alice.“I’m a—I’m a—”“Well! What are you?” said the Pigeon. “I can seeyou’re trying to invent something!”“I—I’m a little girl,” said Alice, rather doubtfully,as she remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.“A likely story indeed!” said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepestcontempt. “I’ve seen a good many little girls in my time, but neverone with such a neck as that! No, no! You’re a serpent; andthere’s no use denying it. I suppose you’ll be telling me next thatyou never tasted an egg!”“I have tasted eggs, certainly,” said Alice, who was a verytruthful child; “but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do,you know.”“I don’t believe it,” said the Pigeon; “but if they do,why then they’re a kind of serpent, that’s all I can say.”This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent for a minute ortwo, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, “You’relooking for eggs, I know that well enough; and what does it matter to mewhether you’re a little girl or a serpent?”“It matters a good deal to me,” said Alice hastily;“but I’m not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, Ishouldn’t want yours: I don’t like them raw.”“Well, be off, then!” said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as itsettled down again into its nest. Alice crouched down among the trees as wellas she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and everynow and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered thatshe still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work verycarefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimestaller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself downto her usual height.It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it feltquite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and begantalking to herself, as usual. “Come, there’s half my plan done now!How puzzling all these changes are! I’m never sure what I’m goingto be, from one minute to another! However, I’ve got back to my rightsize: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden—how isthat to be done, I wonder?” As she said this, she came suddenly upon anopen place, with a little house in it about four feet high. “Whoeverlives there,” thought Alice, “it’ll never do to come uponthem this size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!” Soshe began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go nearthe house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high."

It was opened by another footman in livery, with around face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, hadpowdered hair that curled all over their heads. She felt very curious to knowwhat it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great letter, nearlyas large as himself, and this he handed over to the other, saying, in a solemntone, “For the Duchess. An invitation from the Queen to playcroquet.” The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, onlychanging the order of the words a little, “From the Queen. An invitationfor the Duchess to play croquet.”Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together.Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into the wood for fearof their hearing her; and when she next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone,and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up intothe sky.Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.“There’s no sort of use in knocking,” said the Footman,“and that for two reasons. First, because I’m on the same side ofthe door as you are; secondly, because they’re making such a noiseinside, no one could possibly hear you.” And certainly there was amost extraordinary noise going on within—a constant howling and sneezing,and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken topieces.“Please, then,” said Alice, “how am I to get in?”“There might be some sense in your knocking,” the Footman went onwithout attending to her, “if we had the door between us. For instance,if you were inside, you might knock, and I could let you out, youknow.” He was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking, andthis Alice thought decidedly uncivil. “But perhaps he can’t helpit,” she said to herself; “his eyes are so very nearly atthe top of his head. But at any rate he might answer questions.—How am Ito get in?” she repeated, aloud.“I shall sit here,” the Footman remarked, “tilltomorrow—”At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimmingout, straight at the Footman’s head: it just grazed his nose, and broketo pieces against one of the trees behind him.“—or next day, maybe,” the Footman continued in the sametone, exactly as if nothing had happened.“How am I to get in?” asked Alice again, in a louder tone.“Are you to get in at all?” said the Footman.“That’s the first question, you know.”It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. “It’sreally dreadful,” she muttered to herself, “the way all thecreatures argue. It’s enough to drive one crazy!”The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his remark,with variations. “I shall sit here,” he said, “on and off,for days and days.”“But what am I to do?” said Alice.“Anything you like,” said the Footman, and began whistling.“Oh, there’s no use in talking to him,” said Alicedesperately: “he’s perfectly idiotic!” And she opened thedoor and went in.The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one endto the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle,nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldronwhich seemed to be full of soup.“There’s certainly too much pepper in that soup!” Alice saidto herself, as well as she could for sneezing.There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezedoccasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternatelywithout a moment’s pause. The only things in the kitchen that did notsneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth andgrinning from ear to ear.“Please would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, for shewas not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to speak first,“why your cat grins like that?”“It’s a Cheshire cat,” said the Duchess, “andthat’s why. Pig!”She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; butshe saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her, soshe took courage, and went on again:—“I didn’t know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, Ididn’t know that cats could grin.”“They all can,” said the Duchess; “and most of ’emdo.”“I don’t know of any that do,” Alice said very politely,feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.“You don’t know much,” said the Duchess; “andthat’s a fact.”Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be aswell to introduce some other subject of conversation. While she was trying tofix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set towork throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby—thefire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her; and the baby washowling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blowshurt it or not.“Oh, please mind what you’re doing!” cried Alice,jumping up and down in an agony of terror. “Oh, there goes hisprecious nose!” as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it,and very nearly carried it off.“If everybody minded their own business,” the Duchess said in ahoarse growl, “the world would go round a deal faster than itdoes.”“Which would not be an advantage,” said Alice, who felt veryglad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge.“Just think of what work it would make with the day and night! You seethe earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis—”“Talking of axes,” said the Duchess, “chop off herhead!”Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant to take thehint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to belistening, so she went on again: “Twenty-four hours, I think; oris it twelve? I—”“Oh, don’t bother me,” said the Duchess; “Inever could abide figures!” And with that she began nursing her childagain, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a violentshake at the end of every line:“Speak roughly to your little boy,And beat him when he sneezes:He only does it to annoy,Because he knows it teases.”CHORUS.(In which the cook and the baby joined):“Wow! wow! wow!”While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept tossing the babyviolently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice couldhardly hear the words:—“I speak severely to my boy,I beat him when he sneezes;For he can thoroughly enjoyThe pepper when he pleases!”CHORUS.“Wow! wow! wow!”“Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!” the Duchess said toAlice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke. “I must go and get ready toplay croquet with the Queen,” and she hurried out of the room. The cookthrew a frying-pan after her as she went out, but it just missed her.Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped littlecreature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, “just like astar-fish,” thought Alice. The poor little thing was snorting like asteam-engine when she caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straighteningitself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was asmuch as she could do to hold it.As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it, (which was to twistit up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and leftfoot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,) she carried it out into the openair. “If I don’t take this child away with me,” thoughtAlice, “they’re sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn’t itbe murder to leave it behind?” She said the last words out loud, and thelittle thing grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).“Don’t grunt,” said Alice; “that’s not at all aproper way of expressing yourself.”The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to seewhat was the matter with it. There could be no doubt that it had a veryturn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes weregetting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look ofthe thing at all. “But perhaps it was only sobbing,” she thought,and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.No, there were no tears. “If you’re going to turn into a pig, mydear,” said Alice, seriously, “I’ll have nothing more to dowith you. Mind now!” The poor little thing sobbed again (or grunted, itwas impossible to say which), and they went on for some while in silence.Alice was just beginning to think to herself, “Now, what am I to do withthis creature when I get it home?” when it grunted again, so violently,that she looked down into its face in some alarm. This time there could beno mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and shefelt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further.So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trotaway quietly into the wood. “If it had grown up,” she said toherself, “it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rathera handsome pig, I think.” And she began thinking over other children sheknew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, “ifone only knew the right way to change them—” when she was a littlestartled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yardsoff.The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice. It looked good-natured, she thought:still it had very long claws and a great many teeth, so she felt that itought to be treated with respect.“Cheshire Puss,” she began, rather timidly, as she did not at allknow whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider.“Come, it’s pleased so far,” thought Alice, and she went on.“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said theCat.“I don’t much care where—” said Alice.“Then it doesn’t matter which way you go,” said the Cat.“—so long as I get somewhere,” Alice added as anexplanation.“Oh, you’re sure to do that,” said the Cat, “if youonly walk long enough.”Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another question.“What sort of people live about here?”“In that direction,” the Cat said, waving its right pawround, “lives a Hatter: and in that direction,” waving theother paw, “lives a March Hare. Visit either you like: they’re bothmad.”“But I don’t want to go among mad people,” Alice remarked.“Oh, you can’t help that,” said the Cat: “we’reall mad here. I’m mad. You’re mad.”“How do you know I’m mad?” said Alice.“You must be,” said the Cat, “or you wouldn’t have comehere.”Alice didn’t think that proved it at all; however, she went on “Andhow do you know that you’re mad?”“To begin with,” said the Cat, “a dog’s not mad. Yougrant that?”“I suppose so,” said Alice.“Well, then,” the Cat went on, “you see, a dog growls whenit’s angry, and wags its tail when it’s pleased. Now I growlwhen I’m pleased, and wag my tail when I’m angry. ThereforeI’m mad.”“I call it purring, not growling,” said Alice.“Call it what you like,” said the Cat. “Do you play croquetwith the Queen to-day?”“I should like it very much,” said Alice, “but Ihaven’t been invited yet.”“You’ll see me there,” said the Cat, and vanished.Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used to queer thingshappening. While she was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenlyappeared again.“By-the-bye, what became of the baby?” said the Cat.“I’d nearly forgotten to ask.”“It turned into a pig,” Alice quietly said, just as if it had comeback in a natural way.“I thought it would,” said the Cat, and vanished again.Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear,and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the MarchHare was said to live. “I’ve seen hatters before,” she saidto herself; “the March Hare will be much the most interesting, andperhaps as this is May it won’t be raving mad—at least not so madas it was in March.” As she said this, she looked up, and there was theCat again, sitting on a branch of a tree.“Did you say pig, or fig?” said the Cat.“I said pig,” replied Alice; “and I wish you wouldn’tkeep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.”“All right,” said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remainedsome time after the rest of it had gone.“Well! I’ve often seen a cat without a grin,” thought Alice;“but a grin without a cat! It’s the most curious thing I ever sawin my life!”She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of theMarch Hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys wereshaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. It was so large a house,that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of thelefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even thenshe walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself “Suppose itshould be raving mad after all! I almost wish I’d gone to see the Hatterinstead!”"

No room!” they cried out when they sawAlice coming. “There’s plenty of room!” said Aliceindignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.“Have some wine,” the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea. “Idon’t see any wine,” she remarked.“There isn’t any,” said the March Hare.“Then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,” said Aliceangrily.“It wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without beinginvited,” said the March Hare.“I didn’t know it was your table,” said Alice;“it’s laid for a great many more than three.”“Your hair wants cutting,” said the Hatter. He had been looking atAlice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.“You should learn not to make personal remarks,” Alice said withsome severity; “it’s very rude.”The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he saidwas, “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”“Come, we shall have some fun now!” thought Alice. “I’mglad they’ve begun asking riddles.—I believe I can guessthat,” she added aloud.“Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?”said the March Hare.“Exactly so,” said Alice.“Then you should say what you mean,” the March Hare went on.“I do,” Alice hastily replied; “at least—at least Imean what I say—that’s the same thing, you know.”“Not the same thing a bit!” said the Hatter. “You might justas well say that ‘I see what I eat’ is the same thing as ‘Ieat what I see’!”“You might just as well say,” added the March Hare, “that‘I like what I get’ is the same thing as ‘I get what Ilike’!”“You might just as well say,” added the Dormouse, who seemed to betalking in his sleep, “that ‘I breathe when I sleep’ is thesame thing as ‘I sleep when I breathe’!”“It is the same thing with you,” said the Hatter, and herethe conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alicethought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks, whichwasn’t much.The Hatter was the first to break the silence. “What day of the month isit?” he said, turning to Alice: he had taken his watch out of his pocket,and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding itto his ear.Alice considered a little, and then said “The fourth.”“Two days wrong!” sighed the Hatter. “I told you butterwouldn’t suit the works!” he added looking angrily at the MarchHare.“It was the best butter,” the March Hare meekly replied.“Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,” the Hattergrumbled: “you shouldn’t have put it in with thebread-knife.”The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped it intohis cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of nothing better tosay than his first remark, “It was the best butter, youknow.”Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. “What afunny watch!” she remarked. “It tells the day of the month, anddoesn’t tell what o’clock it is!”“Why should it?” muttered the Hatter. “Does your watchtell you what year it is?”“Of course not,” Alice replied very readily: “butthat’s because it stays the same year for such a long timetogether.”“Which is just the case with mine,” said the Hatter.Alice felt dreadfully puzzled, The Hatter’s remark seemed to have no sortof meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. “I don’t quiteunderstand you,” she said, as politely as she could.“The Dormouse is asleep again,” said the Hatter, and he poured alittle hot tea upon its nose.The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes,“Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.”“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning toAlice again.“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “what’s theanswer?”“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter.“Nor I,” said the March Hare.Alice sighed wearily. “I think you might do something better with thetime,” she said, “than waste it in asking riddles that have noanswers.”“If you knew Time as well as I do,” said the Hatter, “youwouldn’t talk about wasting it. It’s him.”“I don’t know what you mean,” said Alice.“Of course you don’t!” the Hatter said, tossing his headcontemptuously. “I dare say you never even spoke to Time!”“Perhaps not,” Alice cautiously replied: “but I know I haveto beat time when I learn music.”“Ah! that accounts for it,” said the Hatter. “He won’tstand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d doalmost anything you liked with the clock. For instance, suppose it were nineo’clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only haveto whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! Half-pastone, time for dinner!”(“I only wish it was,” the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.)“That would be grand, certainly,” said Alice thoughtfully:“but then—I shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.”“Not at first, perhaps,” said the Hatter: “but you could keepit to half-past one as long as you liked.”“Is that the way you manage?” Alice asked.The Hatter shook his head mournfully. “Not I!” he replied.“We quarrelled last March—just before he went mad, youknow—” (pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,)“—it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and Ihad to sing‘Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!How I wonder what you’re at!’You know the song, perhaps?”“I’ve heard something like it,” said Alice.“It goes on, you know,” the Hatter continued, “in thisway:—‘Up above the world you fly,Like a tea-tray in the sky.Twinkle, twinkle—’”Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep“Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle—” and went on solong that they had to pinch it to make it stop.“Well, I’d hardly finished the first verse,” said the Hatter,“when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ‘He’s murdering thetime! Off with his head!’”“How dreadfully savage!” exclaimed Alice.“And ever since that,” the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,“he won’t do a thing I ask! It’s always six o’clocknow.”A bright idea came into Alice’s head. “Is that the reason so manytea-things are put out here?” she asked.“Yes, that’s it,” said the Hatter with a sigh:“it’s always tea-time, and we’ve no time to wash the thingsbetween whiles.”“Then you keep moving round, I suppose?” said Alice.“Exactly so,” said the Hatter: “as the things get usedup.”“But what happens when you come to the beginning again?” Aliceventured to ask.“Suppose we change the subject,” the March Hare interrupted,yawning. “I’m getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells usa story.”“I’m afraid I don’t know one,” said Alice, ratheralarmed at the proposal.“Then the Dormouse shall!” they both cried. “Wake up,Dormouse!” And they pinched it on both sides at once.The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes. “I wasn’t asleep,” hesaid in a hoarse, feeble voice: “I heard every word you fellows weresaying.”“Tell us a story!” said the March Hare.“Yes, please do!” pleaded Alice.“And be quick about it,” added the Hatter, “or you’llbe asleep again before it’s done.”“Once upon a time there were three little sisters,” the Dormousebegan in a great hurry; “and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie;and they lived at the bottom of a well—”“What did they live on?” said Alice, who always took a greatinterest in questions of eating and drinking.“They lived on treacle,” said the Dormouse, after thinking a minuteor two.“They couldn’t have done that, you know,” Alice gentlyremarked; “they’d have been ill.”“So they were,” said the Dormouse; “very ill.”Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary way of living wouldbe like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: “But why did theylive at the bottom of a well?”“Take some more tea,” the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly.“I’ve had nothing yet,” Alice replied in an offended tone,“so I can’t take more.”“You mean you can’t take less,” said the Hatter:“it’s very easy to take more than nothing.”“Nobody asked your opinion,” said Alice.“Who’s making personal remarks now?” the Hatter askedtriumphantly.Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself to some teaand bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated herquestion. “Why did they live at the bottom of a well?”The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said,“It was a treacle-well.”“There’s no such thing!” Alice was beginning very angrily,but the Hatter and the March Hare went “Sh! sh!” and the Dormousesulkily remarked, “If you can’t be civil, you’d better finishthe story for yourself.”“No, please go on!” Alice said very humbly; “I won’tinterrupt again. I dare say there may be one.”“One, indeed!” said the Dormouse indignantly. However, he consentedto go on. “And so these three little sisters—they were learning todraw, you know—”“What did they draw?” said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.“Treacle,” said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time.“I want a clean cup,” interrupted the Hatter: “let’sall move one place on.”He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him: the March Hare movedinto the Dormouse’s place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place ofthe March Hare. The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from thechange: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare hadjust upset the milk-jug into his plate.Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began very cautiously:“But I don’t understand. Where did they draw the treaclefrom?”“You can draw water out of a water-well,” said the Hatter;“so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well—eh,stupid?”“But they were in the well,” Alice said to the Dormouse, notchoosing to notice this last remark.“Of course they were,” said the Dormouse; “—wellin.”This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse go on for sometime without interrupting it.“They were learning to draw,” the Dormouse went on, yawning andrubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; “and they drew allmanner of things—everything that begins with an M—”“Why with an M?” said Alice.“Why not?” said the March Hare.Alice was silent.The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze;but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, andwent on: “—that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and themoon, and memory, and muchness—you know you say things are “much ofa muchness”—did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of amuchness?”“Really, now you ask me,” said Alice, very much confused, “Idon’t think—”“Then you shouldn’t talk,” said the Hatter.This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she got up in greatdisgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of theothers took the least notice of her going, though she looked back once ortwice, half hoping that they would call after her: the last time she saw them,they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.“At any rate I’ll never go there again!” said Alice asshe picked her way through the wood. “It’s the stupidest tea-partyI ever was at in all my life!”Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door leadingright into it. “That’s very curious!” she thought. “Buteverything’s curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.”And in she went.Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glasstable. “Now, I’ll manage better this time,” she said toherself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door thatled into the garden. Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she hadkept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high: then shewalked down the little passage: and then—she found herself at lastin the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains."

Don’t go splashing paint over me like that!”“I couldn’t help it,” said Five, in a sulky tone;“Seven jogged my elbow.”On which Seven looked up and said, “That’s right, Five! Always laythe blame on others!”“You’d better not talk!” said Five. “I heard theQueen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!”“What for?” said the one who had spoken first.“That’s none of your business, Two!” said Seven.“Yes, it is his business!” said Five, “and I’lltell him—it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead ofonions.”Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun “Well, of all the unjustthings—” when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she stoodwatching them, and he checked himself suddenly: the others looked round also,and all of them bowed low.“Would you tell me,” said Alice, a little timidly, “why youare painting those roses?”Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. Two began in a low voice,“Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been ared rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queenwas to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know. So you see,Miss, we’re doing our best, afore she comes, to—” At thismoment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out“The Queen! The Queen!” and the three gardeners instantly threwthemselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, andAlice looked round, eager to see the Queen.First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the threegardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners: next theten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two andtwo, as the soldiers did. After these came the royal children; there were tenof them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, incouples: they were all ornamented with hearts. Next came the guests, mostlyKings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it wastalking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, andwent by without noticing her. Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying theKing’s crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grandprocession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face likethe three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard of such arule at processions; “and besides, what would be the use of aprocession,” thought she, “if people had all to lie down upon theirfaces, so that they couldn’t see it?” So she stood still where shewas, and waited.When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her,and the Queen said severely “Who is this?” She said it to the Knaveof Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.“Idiot!” said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and, turningto Alice, she went on, “What’s your name, child?”“My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,” said Alice verypolitely; but she added, to herself, “Why, they’re only a pack ofcards, after all. I needn’t be afraid of them!”“And who are these?” said the Queen, pointing to the threegardeners who were lying round the rose-tree; for, you see, as they were lyingon their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of thepack, she could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, orcourtiers, or three of her own children.“How should I know?” said Alice, surprised at her owncourage. “It’s no business of mine.”The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her for a moment likea wild beast, screamed “Off with her head! Off—”“Nonsense!” said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queenwas silent.The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said “Consider, my dear:she is only a child!”The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave “Turn themover!”The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.“Get up!” said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the threegardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, theroyal children, and everybody else.“Leave off that!” screamed the Queen. “You make megiddy.” And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, “Whathave you been doing here?”“May it please your Majesty,” said Two, in a very humble tone,going down on one knee as he spoke, “we were trying—”“I see!” said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examiningthe roses. “Off with their heads!” and the procession moved on,three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners,who ran to Alice for protection.“You shan’t be beheaded!” said Alice, and she put them into alarge flower-pot that stood near. The three soldiers wandered about for aminute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others.“Are their heads off?” shouted the Queen.“Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!” the soldiersshouted in reply.“That’s right!” shouted the Queen. “Can you playcroquet?”The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidentlymeant for her.“Yes!” shouted Alice.“Come on, then!” roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession,wondering very much what would happen next.“It’s—it’s a very fine day!” said a timid voiceat her side. She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiouslyinto her face.“Very,” said Alice: “—where’s the Duchess?”“Hush! Hush!” said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. He lookedanxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe,put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered “She’s under sentenceof execution.”“What for?” said Alice.“Did you say ‘What a pity!’?” the Rabbit asked.“No, I didn’t,” said Alice: “I don’t thinkit’s at all a pity. I said ‘What for?’”“She boxed the Queen’s ears—” the Rabbit began. Alicegave a little scream of laughter. “Oh, hush!” the Rabbit whisperedin a frightened tone. “The Queen will hear you! You see, she came ratherlate, and the Queen said—”“Get to your places!” shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, andpeople began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other;however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began. Alicethought she had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her life; it wasall ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets liveflamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on theirhands and feet, to make the arches.The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo: shesucceeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her arm,with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she had got its neck nicelystraightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, itwould twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a puzzledexpression that she could not help bursting out laughing: and when she had gotits head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find thatthe hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besidesall this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wantedto send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting upand walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusionthat it was a very difficult game indeed.The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all thewhile, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen wasin a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting “Off with hishead!” or “Off with her head!” about once in a minute.Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she had not as yet had any disputewith the Queen, but she knew that it might happen any minute, “andthen,” thought she, “what would become of me? They’redreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, thatthere’s any one left alive!”She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she couldget away without being seen, when she noticed a curious appearance in the air:it puzzled her very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, shemade it out to be a grin, and she said to herself “It’s theCheshire Cat: now I shall have somebody to talk to.”“How are you getting on?” said the Cat, as soon as there was mouthenough for it to speak with.Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. “It’s no usespeaking to it,” she thought, “till its ears have come, or at leastone of them.” In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Aliceput down her flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad shehad someone to listen to her. The Cat seemed to think that there was enough ofit now in sight, and no more of it appeared.“I don’t think they play at all fairly,” Alice began, inrather a complaining tone, “and they all quarrel so dreadfully onecan’t hear oneself speak—and they don’t seem to have anyrules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them—andyou’ve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive; forinstance, there’s the arch I’ve got to go through next walkingabout at the other end of the ground—and I should have croqueted theQueen’s hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it saw minecoming!”“How do you like the Queen?” said the Cat in a low voice.“Not at all,” said Alice: “she’s soextremely—” Just then she noticed that the Queen was close behindher, listening: so she went on, “—likely to win, that it’shardly worth while finishing the game.”The Queen smiled and passed on.“Who are you talking to?” said the King, going up to Alice,and looking at the Cat’s head with great curiosity.“It’s a friend of mine—a Cheshire Cat,” said Alice:“allow me to introduce it.”“I don’t like the look of it at all,” said the King:“however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.”“I’d rather not,” the Cat remarked.“Don’t be impertinent,” said the King, “and don’tlook at me like that!” He got behind Alice as he spoke.“A cat may look at a king,” said Alice. “I’ve read thatin some book, but I don’t remember where.”“Well, it must be removed,” said the King very decidedly, and hecalled the Queen, who was passing at the moment, “My dear! I wish youwould have this cat removed!”The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small.“Off with his head!” she said, without even looking round.“I’ll fetch the executioner myself,” said the King eagerly,and he hurried off.Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, asshe heard the Queen’s voice in the distance, screaming with passion. Shehad already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for havingmissed their turns, and she did not like the look of things at all, as the gamewas in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not. Soshe went in search of her hedgehog.The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed toAlice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: theonly difficulty was, that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of thegarden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly upinto a tree.By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight wasover, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: “but it doesn’tmatter much,” thought Alice, “as all the arches are gone from thisside of the ground.” So she tucked it away under her arm, that it mightnot escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her friend.When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to find quite a largecrowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner,the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest werequite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to settle thequestion, and they repeated their arguments to her, though, as they all spokeat once, she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.The executioner’s argument was, that you couldn’t cut off a headunless there was a body to cut it off from: that he had never had to do such athing before, and he wasn’t going to begin at his time of life.The King’s argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded,and that you weren’t to talk nonsense.The Queen’s argument was, that if something wasn’t done about it inless than no time she’d have everybody executed, all round. (It was thislast remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.)Alice could think of nothing else to say but “It belongs to the Duchess:you’d better ask her about it.”“She’s in prison,” the Queen said to the executioner:“fetch her here.” And the executioner went off like an arrow.The Cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and, by the timehe had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King andthe executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of theparty went back to the game."

Soup does very well without—Maybe it’s always pepperthat makes people hot-tempered,” she went on, very much pleased at havingfound out a new kind of rule, “and vinegar that makes them sour—andcamomile that makes them bitter—and—and barley-sugar and suchthings that make children sweet-tempered. I only wish people knew that:then they wouldn’t be so stingy about it, you know—”She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startledwhen she heard her voice close to her ear. “You’re thinking aboutsomething, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. I can’t tell youjust now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.”“Perhaps it hasn’t one,” Alice ventured to remark.“Tut, tut, child!” said the Duchess. “Everything’s gota moral, if only you can find it.” And she squeezed herself up closer toAlice’s side as she spoke.Alice did not much like keeping so close to her: first, because the Duchess wasvery ugly; and secondly, because she was exactly the right height torest her chin upon Alice’s shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharpchin. However, she did not like to be rude, so she bore it as well as shecould.“The game’s going on rather better now,” she said, by way ofkeeping up the conversation a little.“’Tis so,” said the Duchess: “and the moral of thatis—‘Oh, ’tis love, ’tis love, that makes the world goround!’”“Somebody said,” Alice whispered, “that it’s done byeverybody minding their own business!”“Ah, well! It means much the same thing,” said the Duchess, diggingher sharp little chin into Alice’s shoulder as she added, “and themoral of that is—‘Take care of the sense, and the soundswill take care of themselves.’”“How fond she is of finding morals in things!” Alice thought toherself.“I dare say you’re wondering why I don’t put my arm roundyour waist,” the Duchess said after a pause: “the reason is, thatI’m doubtful about the temper of your flamingo. Shall I try theexperiment?”“He might bite,” Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at allanxious to have the experiment tried.“Very true,” said the Duchess: “flamingoes and mustard bothbite. And the moral of that is—‘Birds of a feather flocktogether.’”“Only mustard isn’t a bird,” Alice remarked.“Right, as usual,” said the Duchess: “what a clear way youhave of putting things!”“It’s a mineral, I think,” said Alice.“Of course it is,” said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree toeverything that Alice said; “there’s a large mustard-mine nearhere. And the moral of that is—‘The more there is of mine, the lessthere is of yours.’”“Oh, I know!” exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this lastremark, “it’s a vegetable. It doesn’t look like one, but itis.”“I quite agree with you,” said the Duchess; “and the moral ofthat is—‘Be what you would seem to be’—or ifyou’d like it put more simply—‘Never imagine yourself not tobe otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or mighthave been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to themto be otherwise.’”“I think I should understand that better,” Alice said verypolitely, “if I had it written down: but I can’t quite follow it asyou say it.”“That’s nothing to what I could say if I chose,” the Duchessreplied, in a pleased tone.“Pray don’t trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,”said Alice.“Oh, don’t talk about trouble!” said the Duchess. “Imake you a present of everything I’ve said as yet.”“A cheap sort of present!” thought Alice. “I’m gladthey don’t give birthday presents like that!” But she did notventure to say it out loud.“Thinking again?” the Duchess asked, with another dig of her sharplittle chin.“I’ve a right to think,” said Alice sharply, for she wasbeginning to feel a little worried.“Just about as much right,” said the Duchess, “as pigs haveto fly; and the m—”But here, to Alice’s great surprise, the Duchess’s voice died away,even in the middle of her favourite word ‘moral,’ and the arm thatwas linked into hers began to tremble. Alice looked up, and there stood theQueen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm.“A fine day, your Majesty!” the Duchess began in a low, weak voice.“Now, I give you fair warning,” shouted the Queen, stamping on theground as she spoke; “either you or your head must be off, and that inabout half no time! Take your choice!”The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.“Let’s go on with the game,” the Queen said to Alice; andAlice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her back tothe croquet-ground.The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen’s absence, and wereresting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her, they hurried back tothe game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment’s delay would costthem their lives.All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with theother players, and shouting “Off with his head!” or “Off withher head!” Those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by thesoldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that bythe end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the players,except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence ofexecution.Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, “Haveyou seen the Mock Turtle yet?”“No,” said Alice. “I don’t even know what a Mock Turtleis.”“It’s the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,” said theQueen.“I never saw one, or heard of one,” said Alice.“Come on, then,” said the Queen, “and he shall tell you hishistory.”As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to thecompany generally, “You are all pardoned.” “Come,that’s a good thing!” she said to herself, for she had feltquite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. (If youdon’t know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.) “Up, lazything!” said the Queen, “and take this young lady to see the MockTurtle, and to hear his history. I must go back and see after some executions Ihave ordered;” and she walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she thoughtit would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: soshe waited.The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she wasout of sight: then it chuckled. “What fun!” said the Gryphon, halfto itself, half to Alice.“What is the fun?” said Alice.“Why, she,” said the Gryphon. “It’s all herfancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know. Come on!”“Everybody says ‘come on!’ here,” thought Alice, as shewent slowly after it: “I never was so ordered about in all my life,never!”They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sittingsad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice couldhear him sighing as if his heart would break. She pitied him deeply.“What is his sorrow?” she asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphonanswered, very nearly in the same words as before, “It’s all hisfancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. Come on!”So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full oftears, but said nothing.“This here young lady,” said the Gryphon, “she wants for toknow your history, she do.”“I’ll tell it her,” said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollowtone: “sit down, both of you, and don’t speak a word tillI’ve finished.”So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself,“I don’t see how he can ever finish, if he doesn’tbegin.” But she waited patiently.“Once,” said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, “Iwas a real Turtle.”These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasionalexclamation of “Hjckrrh!” from the Gryphon, and the constant heavysobbing of the Mock Turtle. Alice was very nearly getting up and saying,“Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,” but she could nothelp thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and saidnothing.“When we were little,” the Mock Turtle went on at last, morecalmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, “we went to school inthe sea. The master was an old Turtle—we used to call himTortoise—”“Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn’t one?” Aliceasked.“We called him Tortoise because he taught us,” said the Mock Turtleangrily: “really you are very dull!”“You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simplequestion,” added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked atpoor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. At last the Gryphon said tothe Mock Turtle, “Drive on, old fellow! Don’t be all day aboutit!” and he went on in these words:“Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believeit—”“I never said I didn’t!” interrupted Alice.“You did,” said the Mock Turtle.“Hold your tongue!” added the Gryphon, before Alice could speakagain. The Mock Turtle went on.“We had the best of educations—in fact, we went to school everyday—”“I’ve been to a day-school, too,” said Alice;“you needn’t be so proud as all that.”“With extras?” asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.“Yes,” said Alice, “we learned French and music.”“And washing?” said the Mock Turtle.“Certainly not!” said Alice indignantly.“Ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,” said the MockTurtle in a tone of great relief. “Now at ours they had at the endof the bill, ‘French, music, andwashing—extra.’”“You couldn’t have wanted it much,” said Alice; “livingat the bottom of the sea.”“I couldn’t afford to learn it.” said the Mock Turtle with asigh. “I only took the regular course.”“What was that?” inquired Alice.“Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,” the Mock Turtlereplied; “and then the different branches of Arithmetic—Ambition,Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.”“I never heard of ‘Uglification,’” Alice ventured tosay. “What is it?”The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. “What! Never heard ofuglifying!” it exclaimed. “You know what to beautify is, Isuppose?”“Yes,” said Alice doubtfully: “itmeans—to—make—anything—prettier.”“Well, then,” the Gryphon went on, “if you don’t knowwhat to uglify is, you are a simpleton.”Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she turnedto the Mock Turtle, and said “What else had you to learn?”“Well, there was Mystery,” the Mock Turtle replied, counting offthe subjects on his flappers, “—Mystery, ancient and modern, withSeaography: then Drawling—the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, thatused to come once a week: he taught us Drawling, Stretching, andFainting in Coils.”“What was that like?” said Alice.“Well, I can’t show it you myself,” the Mock Turtle said:“I’m too stiff. And the Gryphon never learnt it.”“Hadn’t time,” said the Gryphon: “I went to theClassics master, though. He was an old crab, he was.”“I never went to him,” the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: “hetaught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.”“So he did, so he did,” said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn; andboth creatures hid their faces in their paws.“And how many hours a day did you do lessons?” said Alice, in ahurry to change the subject.“Ten hours the first day,” said the Mock Turtle: “nine thenext, and so on.”“What a curious plan!” exclaimed Alice.“That’s the reason they’re called lessons,” the Gryphonremarked: “because they lessen from day to day.”This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a little before shemade her next remark. “Then the eleventh day must have been aholiday?”“Of course it was,” said the Mock Turtle.“And how did you manage on the twelfth?” Alice went on eagerly.“That’s enough about lessons,” the Gryphon interrupted in avery decided tone: “tell her something about the games now.”"

He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobschoked his voice. “Same as if he had a bone in his throat,” saidthe Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back. Atlast the Mock Turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears running down hischeeks, he went on again:—“You may not have lived much under the sea—” (“Ihaven’t,” said Alice)—“and perhaps you were never evenintroduced to a lobster—” (Alice began to say “I oncetasted—” but checked herself hastily, and said “No,never”) “—so you can have no idea what a delightful thing aLobster Quadrille is!”“No, indeed,” said Alice. “What sort of a dance is it?”“Why,” said the Gryphon, “you first form into a line alongthe sea-shore—”“Two lines!” cried the Mock Turtle. “Seals, turtles, salmon,and so on; then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of theway—”“That generally takes some time,” interrupted the Gryphon.“—you advance twice—”“Each with a lobster as a partner!” cried the Gryphon.“Of course,” the Mock Turtle said: “advance twice, set topartners—”“—change lobsters, and retire in same order,” continued theGryphon.“Then, you know,” the Mock Turtle went on, “you throwthe—”“The lobsters!” shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.“—as far out to sea as you can—”“Swim after them!” screamed the Gryphon.“Turn a somersault in the sea!” cried the Mock Turtle, caperingwildly about.“Change lobsters again!” yelled the Gryphon at the top of itsvoice.“Back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,” saidthe Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who hadbeen jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly andquietly, and looked at Alice.“It must be a very pretty dance,” said Alice timidly.“Would you like to see a little of it?” said the Mock Turtle.“Very much indeed,” said Alice.“Come, let’s try the first figure!” said the Mock Turtle tothe Gryphon. “We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shallsing?”“Oh, you sing,” said the Gryphon. “I’veforgotten the words.”So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and thentreading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws tomark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:—“Will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.“There’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s treading on my tail.See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!They are waiting on the shingle—will you come and join the dance?Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?“You can really have no notion how delightful it will beWhen they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!”But the snail replied “Too far, too far!” and gave a look askance—Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the dance.Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance.Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance.“What matters it how far we go?” his scaly friend replied.“There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.The further off from England the nearer is to France—Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?Will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”“Thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,” saidAlice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: “and I do so like thatcurious song about the whiting!”“Oh, as to the whiting,” said the Mock Turtle,“they—you’ve seen them, of course?”“Yes,” said Alice, “I’ve often seen them atdinn—” she checked herself hastily.“I don’t know where Dinn may be,” said the Mock Turtle,“but if you’ve seen them so often, of course you know whatthey’re like.”“I believe so,” Alice replied thoughtfully. “They have theirtails in their mouths—and they’re all over crumbs.”“You’re wrong about the crumbs,” said the Mock Turtle:“crumbs would all wash off in the sea. But they have their tailsin their mouths; and the reason is—” here the Mock Turtle yawnedand shut his eyes.—“Tell her about the reason and all that,”he said to the Gryphon.“The reason is,” said the Gryphon, “that they would gowith the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea. So they had tofall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So theycouldn’t get them out again. That’s all.”“Thank you,” said Alice, “it’s very interesting. Inever knew so much about a whiting before.”“I can tell you more than that, if you like,” said the Gryphon.“Do you know why it’s called a whiting?”“I never thought about it,” said Alice. “Why?”“It does the boots and shoes,” the Gryphon replied verysolemnly.Alice was thoroughly puzzled. “Does the boots and shoes!” sherepeated in a wondering tone.“Why, what are your shoes done with?” said the Gryphon.“I mean, what makes them so shiny?”Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her answer.“They’re done with blacking, I believe.”“Boots and shoes under the sea,” the Gryphon went on in a deepvoice, “are done with a whiting. Now you know.”“And what are they made of?” Alice asked in a tone of greatcuriosity.“Soles and eels, of course,” the Gryphon replied ratherimpatiently: “any shrimp could have told you that.”“If I’d been the whiting,” said Alice, whose thoughts werestill running on the song, “I’d have said to the porpoise,‘Keep back, please: we don’t want you with us!’”“They were obliged to have him with them,” the Mock Turtle said:“no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.”“Wouldn’t it really?” said Alice in a tone of great surprise.“Of course not,” said the Mock Turtle: “why, if a fish cameto me, and told me he was going a journey, I should say ‘With whatporpoise?’”“Don’t you mean ‘purpose’?” said Alice.“I mean what I say,” the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.And the Gryphon added “Come, let’s hear some of youradventures.”“I could tell you my adventures—beginning from this morning,”said Alice a little timidly: “but it’s no use going back toyesterday, because I was a different person then.”“Explain all that,” said the Mock Turtle.“No, no! The adventures first,” said the Gryphon in an impatienttone: “explanations take such a dreadful time.”So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw theWhite Rabbit. She was a little nervous about it just at first, the twocreatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened their eyes andmouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went on. Herlisteners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating“You are old, Father William,” to the Caterpillar, and thewords all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, andsaid “That’s very curious.”“It’s all about as curious as it can be,” said the Gryphon.“It all came different!” the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully.“I should like to hear her try and repeat something now. Tell her tobegin.” He looked at the Gryphon as if he thought it had some kind ofauthority over Alice.“Stand up and repeat ‘’Tis the voice of thesluggard,’” said the Gryphon.“How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!”thought Alice; “I might as well be at school at once.” However, shegot up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the LobsterQuadrille, that she hardly knew what she was saying, and the words came veryqueer indeed:—“’Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,“You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.”As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his noseTrims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.”[later editions continued as followsWhen the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]“That’s different from what I used to say when I was achild,” said the Gryphon.“Well, I never heard it before,” said the Mock Turtle; “butit sounds uncommon nonsense.”Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands, wondering ifanything would ever happen in a natural way again.“I should like to have it explained,” said the Mock Turtle.“She can’t explain it,” said the Gryphon hastily. “Goon with the next verse.”“But about his toes?” the Mock Turtle persisted. “Howcould he turn them out with his nose, you know?”“It’s the first position in dancing.” Alice said; but wasdreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.“Go on with the next verse,” the Gryphon repeated impatiently:“it begins ‘I passed by his garden.’”Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong,and she went on in a trembling voice:—“I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie—”[later editions continued as followsThe Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,And concluded the banquet—]“What is the use of repeating all that stuff,” the MockTurtle interrupted, “if you don’t explain it as you go on?It’s by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!”“Yes, I think you’d better leave off,” said the Gryphon: andAlice was only too glad to do so.“Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?” the Gryphonwent on. “Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?”“Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,” Alicereplied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,“Hm! No accounting for tastes! Sing her ‘Turtle Soup,’will you, old fellow?”The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked withsobs, to sing this:—“Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,Waiting in a hot tureen!Who for such dainties would not stoop?Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,Beautiful, beautiful Soup!“Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish,Game, or any other dish?Who would not give all else for two pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!Beau—ootiful Soo—oop!Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,Beautiful, beauti—FUL SOUP!”“Chorus again!” cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had justbegun to repeat it, when a cry of “The trial’s beginning!”was heard in the distance.“Come on!” cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, ithurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.“What trial is it?” Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon onlyanswered “Come on!” and ran the faster, while more and more faintlycame, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:—“Soo—oop of the e—e—evening,Beautiful, beautiful Soup!”"

",この物語は、アリスという名の少女が、川辺で座っているときに退屈で眠くなり、白ウサギに出会ってウサギの穴からウサギを追いかけ、不思議な生き物と気まぐれな冒険に満ちた空想の世界に飛び込むというものである,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/11/images/cover.jpg,Who Stole the Tarts?,"The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived,with a great crowd assembled about them—all sorts of little birds andbeasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them,in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him; and near the King was theWhite Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in theother. In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tartsupon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look atthem—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought,“and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no chanceof this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time.Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read about themin books, and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearlyeverything there. “That’s the judge,” she said to herself,“because of his great wig.”The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown over the wig,(look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he did it,) he did not look atall comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming.“And that’s the jury-box,” thought Alice, “and thosetwelve creatures,” (she was obliged to say “creatures,” yousee, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,) “I supposethey are the jurors.” She said this last word two or three times over toherself, being rather proud of it: for she thought, and rightly too, that veryfew little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all. However,“jury-men” would have done just as well.The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. “What are theydoing?” Alice whispered to the Gryphon. “They can’t haveanything to put down yet, before the trial’s begun.”“They’re putting down their names,” the Gryphon whispered inreply, “for fear they should forget them before the end of thetrial.”“Stupid things!” Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but shestopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, “Silence in thecourt!” and the King put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, tomake out who was talking.Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders, that allthe jurors were writing down “stupid things!” on their slates, andshe could even make out that one of them didn’t know how to spell“stupid,” and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him.“A nice muddle their slates’ll be in before the trial’sover!” thought Alice.One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. This of course, Alice couldnot stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and verysoon found an opportunity of taking it away. She did it so quickly that thepoor little juror (it was Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what hadbecome of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write withone finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it leftno mark on the slate.“Herald, read the accusation!” said the King.On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolledthe parchment scroll, and read as follows:—“The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,All on a summer day:The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,And took them quite away!”“Consider your verdict,” the King said to the jury.“Not yet, not yet!” the Rabbit hastily interrupted.“There’s a great deal to come before that!”“Call the first witness,” said the King; and the White Rabbit blewthree blasts on the trumpet, and called out, “First witness!”The first witness was the Hatter. He came in with a teacup in one hand and apiece of bread-and-butter in the other. “I beg pardon, yourMajesty,” he began, “for bringing these in: but I hadn’tquite finished my tea when I was sent for.”“You ought to have finished,” said the King. “When did youbegin?”The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into the court,arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. “Fourteenth of March, I think itwas,” he said.“Fifteenth,” said the March Hare.“Sixteenth,” added the Dormouse.“Write that down,” the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerlywrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reducedthe answer to shillings and pence.“Take off your hat,” the King said to the Hatter.“It isn’t mine,” said the Hatter.“Stolen!” the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, whoinstantly made a memorandum of the fact.“I keep them to sell,” the Hatter added as an explanation;“I’ve none of my own. I’m a hatter.”Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, whoturned pale and fidgeted.“Give your evidence,” said the King; “and don’t benervous, or I’ll have you executed on the spot.”This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he kept shifting from onefoot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his confusion he bit alarge piece out of his teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her agood deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to grow largeragain, and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court; but onsecond thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was roomfor her.“I wish you wouldn’t squeeze so.” said the Dormouse, who wassitting next to her. “I can hardly breathe.”“I can’t help it,” said Alice very meekly: “I’mgrowing.”“You’ve no right to grow here,” said the Dormouse.“Don’t talk nonsense,” said Alice more boldly: “youknow you’re growing too.”“Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,” said the Dormouse:“not in that ridiculous fashion.” And he got up very sulkily andcrossed over to the other side of the court.All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just asthe Dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers of the court,“Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!” on whichthe wretched Hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.“Give your evidence,” the King repeated angrily, “orI’ll have you executed, whether you’re nervous or not.”“I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” the Hatter began, in atrembling voice, “—and I hadn’t begun my tea—not abovea week or so—and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin—andthe twinkling of the tea—”“The twinkling of the what?” said the King.“It began with the tea,” the Hatter replied.“Of course twinkling begins with a T!” said the King sharply.“Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!”“I’m a poor man,” the Hatter went on, “and most thingstwinkled after that—only the March Hare said—”“I didn’t!” the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.“You did!” said the Hatter.“I deny it!” said the March Hare.“He denies it,” said the King: “leave out that part.”“Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said—” the Hatter went on,looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the Dormouse deniednothing, being fast asleep.“After that,” continued the Hatter, “I cut some morebread-and-butter—”“But what did the Dormouse say?” one of the jury asked.“That I can’t remember,” said the Hatter.“You must remember,” remarked the King, “or I’llhave you executed.”The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down onone knee. “I’m a poor man, your Majesty,” he began.“You’re a very poor speaker,” said the King.Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by theofficers of the court. (As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain toyou how it was done. They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouthwith strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then satupon it.)“I’m glad I’ve seen that done,” thought Alice.“I’ve so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials,“There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed bythe officers of the court,” and I never understood what it meant tillnow.”“If that’s all you know about it, you may stand down,”continued the King.“I can’t go no lower,” said the Hatter: “I’m onthe floor, as it is.”“Then you may sit down,” the King replied.Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.“Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!” thought Alice. “Now weshall get on better.”“I’d rather finish my tea,” said the Hatter, with an anxiouslook at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.“You may go,” said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left thecourt, without even waiting to put his shoes on.“—and just take his head off outside,” the Queen added to oneof the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could getto the door.“Call the next witness!” said the King.The next witness was the Duchess’s cook. She carried the pepper-box inher hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the court, bythe way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.“Give your evidence,” said the King.“Shan’t,” said the cook.The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice,“Your Majesty must cross-examine this witness.”“Well, if I must, I must,” the King said, with a melancholy air,and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were nearlyout of sight, he said in a deep voice, “What are tarts made of?”“Pepper, mostly,” said the cook.“Treacle,” said a sleepy voice behind her.“Collar that Dormouse,” the Queen shrieked out. “Behead thatDormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him! Pinch him! Off withhis whiskers!”For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turnedout, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared.“Never mind!” said the King, with an air of great relief.“Call the next witness.” And he added in an undertone to the Queen,“Really, my dear, you must cross-examine the next witness. Itquite makes my forehead ache!”Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling verycurious to see what the next witness would be like, “—for theyhaven’t got much evidence yet,” she said to herself. Imagineher surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill littlevoice, the name “Alice!”"

She soon got it out again, andput it right; “not that it signifies much,” she said to herself;“I should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one wayup as the other.”As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, andtheir slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set towork very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except theLizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouthopen, gazing up into the roof of the court.“What do you know about this business?” the King said to Alice.“Nothing,” said Alice.“Nothing whatever?” persisted the King.“Nothing whatever,” said Alice.“That’s very important,” the King said, turning to the jury.They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the WhiteRabbit interrupted: “Unimportant, your Majesty means, ofcourse,” he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making facesat him as he spoke.“Unimportant, of course, I meant,” the King hastily said,and went on to himself in an undertone,“important—unimportant—unimportant—important—”as if he were trying which word sounded best.Some of the jury wrote it down “important,” and some“unimportant.” Alice could see this, as she was near enough to lookover their slates; “but it doesn’t matter a bit,” she thoughtto herself.At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in hisnote-book, cackled out “Silence!” and read out from his book,“Rule Forty-two. All persons more than a mile high to leave thecourt.”Everybody looked at Alice.“I’m not a mile high,” said Alice.“You are,” said the King.“Nearly two miles high,” added the Queen.“Well, I shan’t go, at any rate,” said Alice: “besides,that’s not a regular rule: you invented it just now.”“It’s the oldest rule in the book,” said the King.“Then it ought to be Number One,” said Alice.The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. “Consider yourverdict,” he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.“There’s more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,”said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; “this paper has justbeen picked up.”“What’s in it?” said the Queen.“I haven’t opened it yet,” said the White Rabbit, “butit seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to—to somebody.”“It must have been that,” said the King, “unless it waswritten to nobody, which isn’t usual, you know.”“Who is it directed to?” said one of the jurymen.“It isn’t directed at all,” said the White Rabbit; “infact, there’s nothing written on the outside.” He unfoldedthe paper as he spoke, and added “It isn’t a letter, after all:it’s a set of verses.”“Are they in the prisoner’s handwriting?” asked another ofthe jurymen.“No, they’re not,” said the White Rabbit, “andthat’s the queerest thing about it.” (The jury all looked puzzled.)“He must have imitated somebody else’s hand,” said the King.(The jury all brightened up again.)“Please your Majesty,” said the Knave, “I didn’t writeit, and they can’t prove I did: there’s no name signed at theend.”“If you didn’t sign it,” said the King, “that onlymakes the matter worse. You must have meant some mischief, or elseyou’d have signed your name like an honest man.”There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really cleverthing the King had said that day.“That proves his guilt,” said the Queen.“It proves nothing of the sort!” said Alice. “Why, youdon’t even know what they’re about!”“Read them,” said the King.The White Rabbit put on his spectacles. “Where shall I begin, please yourMajesty?” he asked.“Begin at the beginning,” the King said gravely, “and go ontill you come to the end: then stop.”These were the verses the White Rabbit read:—“They told me you had been to her,And mentioned me to him:She gave me a good character,But said I could not swim.He sent them word I had not gone(We know it to be true):If she should push the matter on,What would become of you?I gave her one, they gave him two,You gave us three or more;They all returned from him to you,Though they were mine before.If I or she should chance to beInvolved in this affair,He trusts to you to set them free,Exactly as we were.My notion was that you had been(Before she had this fit)An obstacle that came betweenHim, and ourselves, and it.Don’t let him know she liked them best,For this must ever beA secret, kept from all the rest,Between yourself and me.”“That’s the most important piece of evidence we’ve heardyet,” said the King, rubbing his hands; “so now let thejury—”“If any one of them can explain it,” said Alice, (she had grown solarge in the last few minutes that she wasn’t a bit afraid ofinterrupting him,) “I’ll give him sixpence. I don’tbelieve there’s an atom of meaning in it.”The jury all wrote down on their slates, “She doesn’tbelieve there’s an atom of meaning in it,” but none of themattempted to explain the paper.“If there’s no meaning in it,” said the King, “thatsaves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn’t try to find any. Andyet I don’t know,” he went on, spreading out the verses on hisknee, and looking at them with one eye; “I seem to see some meaning inthem, after all. “—said I could not swim—” youcan’t swim, can you?” he added, turning to the Knave.The Knave shook his head sadly. “Do I look like it?” he said.(Which he certainly did not, being made entirely of cardboard.)“All right, so far,” said the King, and he went on muttering overthe verses to himself: “‘We know it to be true—’that’s the jury, of course—‘I gave her one, they gave himtwo—’ why, that must be what he did with the tarts, youknow—”“But, it goes on ‘they all returned from him toyou,’” said Alice.“Why, there they are!” said the King triumphantly, pointing to thetarts on the table. “Nothing can be clearer than that. Thenagain—‘before she had this fit—’ you never hadfits, my dear, I think?” he said to the Queen.“Never!” said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at theLizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on hisslate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily beganagain, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)“Then the words don’t fit you,” said the King, lookinground the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.“It’s a pun!” the King added in an offended tone, andeverybody laughed, “Let the jury consider their verdict,” the Kingsaid, for about the twentieth time that day.“No, no!” said the Queen. “Sentence first—verdictafterwards.”“Stuff and nonsense!” said Alice loudly. “The idea of havingthe sentence first!”“Hold your tongue!” said the Queen, turning purple.“I won’t!” said Alice.“Off with her head!” the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.Nobody moved.“Who cares for you?” said Alice, (she had grown to her full size bythis time.) “You’re nothing but a pack of cards!”At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her: shegave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat themoff, and found herself lying on the bank, with her head in the lap of hersister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered downfrom the trees upon her face.“Wake up, Alice dear!” said her sister; “Why, what a longsleep you’ve had!”“Oh, I’ve had such a curious dream!” said Alice, and she toldher sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange Adventures ofhers that you have just been reading about; and when she had finished, hersister kissed her, and said, “It was a curious dream, dear,certainly: but now run in to your tea; it’s getting late.” So Alicegot up and ran off, thinking while she ran, as well she might, what a wonderfuldream it had been.But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her head on her hand,watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her wonderfulAdventures, till she too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was herdream:—First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands wereclasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up intohers—she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that queerlittle toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that wouldalways get into her eyes—and still as she listened, or seemed to listen,the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of herlittle sister’s dream.The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried by—thefrightened Mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool—she couldhear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his friends shared theirnever-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off herunfortunate guests to execution—once more the pig-baby was sneezing onthe Duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it—oncemore the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard’sslate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air,mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland,though she knew she had but to open them again, and all would change to dullreality—the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the poolrippling to the waving of the reeds—the rattling teacups would change totinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen’s shrill cries to the voice of theshepherd boy—and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, andall the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the confused clamour ofthe busy farm-yard—while the lowing of the cattle in the distance wouldtake the place of the Mock Turtle’s heavy sobs.Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, inthe after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would keep, through allher riper years, the simple and loving heart of her childhood: and how shewould gather about her other little children, and make their eyes brightand eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderlandof long ago: and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find apleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her own child-life, and thehappy summer days."

Itwas true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thinlight hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face wasyellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in oneway or another. Her father had held a position under the EnglishGovernment and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother hadbeen a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herselfwith gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Marywas born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made tounderstand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep thechild out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly,fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when shebecame a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the wayalso. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark facesof her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed herand gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would beangry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six yearsold she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. Theyoung English governess who came to teach her to read and write dislikedher so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when othergovernesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shortertime than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want toknow how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, sheawakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she sawthat the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.""Why did you come?"" she said to the strange woman. ""I will not let youstay. Send my Ayah to me.""The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah couldnot come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kickedher, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was notpossible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was donein its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing,while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scaredfaces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. Shewas actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wanderedout into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near theveranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuckbig scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the timegrowing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things shewould say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.""Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!"" she said, because to call a native a pigis the worst insult of all.She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when sheheard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with afair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard thathe was a very young officer who had just come from England. The childstared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did thiswhen she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used tocall her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, prettyperson and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk andshe had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, andshe had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, andMary said they were ""full of lace."" They looked fuller of lace than everthis morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large andscared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.""Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?"" Mary heard her say.""Awfully,"" the young man answered in a trembling voice. ""Awfully, Mrs.Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.""The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.""Oh, I know I ought!"" she cried. ""I only stayed to go to that sillydinner party. What a fool I was!""At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from theservants' quarters that she clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stoodshivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.""What is it? What is it?"" Mrs. Lennox gasped.""Some one has died,"" answered the boy officer. ""You did not say it hadbroken out among your servants.""""I did not know!"" the Mem Sahib cried. ""Come with me! Come with me!"" andshe turned and ran into the house.After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of themorning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its mostfatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken illin the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants hadwailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were deadand others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, anddying people in all the bungalows.During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herselfin the nursery and was forgotten by every one. Nobody thought of her,nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knewnothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She onlyknew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frighteningsounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though apartly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked asif they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly forsome reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirstyshe drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, andshe did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intenselydrowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again,frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound offeet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyesopen and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, butshe was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carriedin and out of the bungalow.When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house wasperfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. Sheheard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had gotwell of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also whowould take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah,and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tiredof the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was notan affectionate child and had never cared much for any one. The noiseand hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, andshe had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive.Every one was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one wasfond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they rememberednothing but themselves. But if every one had got well again, surely someone would remember and come to look for her.But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow moreand more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and whenshe looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching herwith eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmlesslittle thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get outof the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.""How queer and quiet it is,"" she said. ""It sounds as if there was no onein the bungalow but me and the snake.""Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then onthe veranda. They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalowand talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and theyseemed to open doors and look into rooms.""What desolation!"" she heard one voice say. ""That pretty, pretty woman!I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one eversaw her.""Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the doora few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and wasfrowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefullyneglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had onceseen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when hesaw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.""Barney!"" he cried out. ""There is a child here! A child alone! In aplace like this! Mercy on us, who is she!""""I am Mary Lennox,"" the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow ""A placelike this!"" ""I fell asleep when every one had the cholera and I haveonly just wakened up. Why does nobody come?""""It is the child no one ever saw!"" exclaimed the man, turning to hiscompanions. ""She has actually been forgotten!""""Why was I forgotten?"" Mary said, stamping her foot. ""Why does nobodycome?""The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary eventhought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.""Poor little kid!"" he said. ""There is nobody left to come.""It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she hadneither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried awayin the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also hadleft the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them evenremembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was soquiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself andthe little rustling snake."

She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was aself-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she hadalways done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been veryanxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and asshe had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going tonice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as herAyah and the other native servants had done.She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's housewhere she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The Englishclergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age andthey wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toysfrom each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was sodisagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would playwith her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made herfurious.It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy withimpudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose and Mary hated him. She wasplaying by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the daythe cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for agarden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he gotrather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.""Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?""he said. ""There in the middle,"" and he leaned over her to point.""Go away!"" cried Mary. ""I don't want boys. Go away!""For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He wasalways teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made facesand sang and laughed.He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and thecrosser Mary got, the more they sang ""Mistress Mary, quite contrary"";and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her ""MistressMary Quite Contrary"" when they spoke of her to each other, and oftenwhen they spoke to her.""You are going to be sent home,"" Basil said to her, ""at the end of theweek. And we're glad of it.""""I am glad of it, too,"" answered Mary. ""Where is home?""""She doesn't know where home is!"" said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.""It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabelwas sent to her last year. You are not going to your grandmama. You havenone. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Archibald Craven.""""I don't know anything about him,"" snapped Mary.""I know you don't,"" Basil answered. ""You don't know anything. Girlsnever do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in agreat, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.He's so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he would letthem. He's a hunchback, and he's horrid.""""I don't believe you,"" said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck herfingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawfordtold her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a fewdays and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived atMisselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterestedthat they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind toher, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted tokiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted hershoulder.""She is such a plain child,"" Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.""And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very prettymanner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in achild. The children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and thoughit's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it.""""Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her prettymanners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some prettyways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, toremember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.""""I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,"" sighed Mrs. Crawford.""When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the littlething. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone inthat deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of hisskin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in themiddle of the room.""Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer'swife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and wasrather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Cravensent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper atMisselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stoutwoman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purpledress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet withpurple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved herhead. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked peoplethere was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evidentMrs. Medlock did not think much of her.""My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!"" she said. ""And we'dheard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn't handed much of it down,has she, ma'am?""""Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,"" the officer's wife saidgood-naturedly. ""If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression,her features are rather good. Children alter so much.""""She'll have to alter a good deal,"" answered Mrs. Medlock. ""And there'snothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite—if you ask me!""They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a littleapart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. Shewas watching the passing buses and cabs, and people, but she heard quitewell and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he livedin. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was ahunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.Since she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah,she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were newto her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong toany one even when her father and mother had been alive. Other childrenseemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemedto really be any one's little girl. She had had servants, and food andclothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know thatthis was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, shedid not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other peoplewere, but she did not know that she was so herself.She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen,with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. Whenthe next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walkedthrough the station to the railway carriage with her head up and tryingto keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want toseem to belong to her. It would have made her very angry to think peopleimagined she was her little girl.But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts.She was the kind of woman who would ""stand no nonsense from young ones.""At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked. Shehad not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria's daughter wasgoing to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place ashousekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she couldkeep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. Shenever dared even to ask a question.""Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,"" Mr. Craven had saidin his short, cold way. ""Captain Lennox was my wife's brother and I amtheir daughter's guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must goto London and bring her yourself.""So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain andfretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded herthin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her lookyellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under herblack crêpe hat.""A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,"" Mrs. Medlockthought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) Shehad never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and atlast she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hardvoice.""I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are goingto,"" she said. ""Do you know anything about your uncle?""""No,"" said Mary.""Never heard your father and mother talk about him?""""No,"" said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that herfather and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.Certainly they had never told her things.""Humph,"" muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsivelittle face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then shebegan again.""I suppose you might as well be told something—to prepare you. You aregoing to a queer place.""Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited byher apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.""Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven'sproud of it in his way—and that's gloomy enough, too. The house is sixhundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near ahundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked. Andthere's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there forages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees withbranches trailing to the ground—some of them."" She paused and tookanother breath. ""But there's nothing else,"" she ended suddenly.Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlikeIndia, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend tolook as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy,disagreeable ways. So she sat still.""Well,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""What do you think of it?""""Nothing,"" she answered. ""I know nothing about such places.""That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.""Eh!"" she said, ""but you are like an old woman. Don't you care?""""It doesn't matter,"" said Mary, ""whether I care or not.""""You are right enough there,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""It doesn't. Whatyou're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don't know, unlessbecause it's the easiest way. He's not going to trouble himself aboutyou, that's sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.""She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.""He's got a crooked back,"" she said. ""That set him wrong. He was a souryoung man and got no good of all his money and big place till he wasmarried.""Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem tocare. She had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she wasa trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkativewoman she continued with more interest. This was one way of passing someof the time, at any rate.""She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked the world over toget her a blade o' grass she wanted. Nobody thought she'd marry him, butshe did, and people said she married him for his money. But shedidn't—she didn't,"" positively. ""When she died—""Mary gave a little involuntary jump.""Oh! did she die!"" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had justremembered a French fairy story she had once read called ""Riquet à laHouppe."" It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess andit had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.""Yes, she died,"" Mrs. Medlock answered. ""And it made him queerer thanever. He cares about nobody. He won't see people. Most of the time hegoes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in theWest Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him. Pitcher's an oldfellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows hisways.""It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feelcheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and withtheir doors locked—a house on the edge of a moor—whatsoever a moorwas—sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and itseemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down ingray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If thepretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by beingsomething like her own mother and by running in and out and going toparties as she had done in frocks ""full of lace."" But she was not thereany more.""You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one you won't,"" said Mrs.Medlock. ""And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk toyou. You'll have to play about and look after yourself. You'll be toldwhat rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of. There'sgardens enough. But when you're in the house don't go wandering andpoking about. Mr. Craven won't have it.""""I shall not want to go poking about,"" said sour little Mary; and justas suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Cravenshe began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough todeserve all that had happened to him.And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of therailway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as ifit would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadilythat the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fellasleep."

The rain seemed to bestreaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station worewet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in thecarriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chickenand beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, andMary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one sideuntil she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage,lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quitedark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station andMrs. Medlock was shaking her.""You have had a sleep!"" she said. ""It's time to open your eyes! We're atThwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us.""Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlockcollected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her,because in India native servants always picked up or carried things andit seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to begetting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in arough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashionwhich Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.""I see tha's got back,"" he said. ""An' tha's browt th' young 'un withthee.""""Aye, that's her,"" answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshireaccent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.""How's thy Missus?""""Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.""A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Marysaw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman whohelped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering ofhis hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burlystation-master included.When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they droveoff, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushionedcorner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat andlooked out of the window, curious to see something of the road overwhich she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spokenof. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened,but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house witha hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing on the edge of amoor.""What is a moor?"" she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.""Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,"" the womananswered. ""We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before weget to the Manor. You won't see much because it's a dark night, but youcan see something.""Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner,keeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light alittle distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things theypassed. After they had left the station they had driven through a tinyvillage and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a publichouse. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a littleshop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things setout for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges andtrees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time—or atleast it seemed a long time to her.At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbingup-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no moretrees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on eitherside. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just asthe carriage gave a big jolt.""Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,"" said Mrs. Medlock.The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road whichseemed to be cut through bushes and low growing things which ended inthe great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.""It's—it's not the sea, is it?"" said Mary, looking round at hercompanion.""No, not it,"" answered Mrs. Medlock. ""Nor it isn't fields nor mountains,it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows onbut heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild poniesand sheep.""""I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,"" saidMary. ""It sounds like the sea just now.""""That's the wind blowing through the bushes,"" Mrs. Medlock said. ""It's awild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likesit—particularly when the heather's in bloom.""On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped,the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road wentup and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridgebeneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Maryfelt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleakmoor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing ona strip of dry land.""I don't like it,"" she said to herself. ""I don't like it,"" and shepinched her thin lips more tightly together.The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caughtsight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a longsigh of relief.""Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling,"" she exclaimed. ""It'sthe light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea after abit, at all events.""It was ""after a bit,"" as she said, for when the carriage passed throughthe park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through andthe trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they weredriving through a long dark vault.They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before animmensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stonecourt. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in thewindows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in acorner up-stairs showed a dull glow.The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shapedpanels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great ironbars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted thatthe faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits ofarmor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she stoodon the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, andshe felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door forthem.""You are to take her to her room,"" he said in a husky voice. ""He doesn'twant to see her. He's going to London in the morning.""""Very well, Mr. Pitcher,"" Mrs. Medlock answered. ""So long as I knowwhat's expected of me, I can manage.""""What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,"" Mr. Pitcher said, ""is that youmake sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what hedoesn't want to see.""And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a longcorridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor andanother, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a roomwith a fire in it and a supper on a table.Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:""Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you'll live—andyou must keep to them. Don't you forget that!""It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and shehad perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life."

Mary lay and watched her fora few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seena room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls werecovered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There werefantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance therewas a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and horsesand dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them.Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of landwhich seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless,dull, purplish sea.""What is that?"" she said, pointing out of the window.Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked andpointed also.""That there?"" she said.""Yes.""""That's th' moor,"" with a good-natured grin. ""Does tha' like it?""""No,"" answered Mary. ""I hate it.""""That's because tha'rt not used to it,"" Martha said, going back to herhearth. ""Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now. But tha' will like it.""""Do you?"" inquired Mary.""Aye, that I do,"" answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at thegrate. ""I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' thingsas smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorsean' broom an' heather's in flower. It smells o' honey an' there's such alot o' fresh air—an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarksmakes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'. Eh! I wouldn't live awayfrom th' moor for anythin'.""Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The nativeservants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to theirmasters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them""protector of the poor"" and names of that sort. Indian servants werecommanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say""please"" and ""thank you"" and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in theface when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would doif one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-naturedlooking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Marywonder if she might not even slap back—if the person who slapped herwas only a little girl.""You are a strange servant,"" she said from her pillows, ratherhaughtily.Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, andlaughed, without seeming the least out of temper.""Eh! I know that,"" she said. ""If there was a grand Missus atMisselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under housemaids.I might have been let to be scullery-maid but I'd never have been letup-stairs. I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is afunny house for all it's so grand. Seems like there's neither Master norMistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he won't betroubled about anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away.Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness. She told me she couldnever have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.""""Are you going to be my servant?"" Mary asked, still in her imperiouslittle Indian way.Martha began to rub her grate again.""I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant,"" she said stoutly. ""An' she's Mr.Craven's—but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an' wait on you abit. But you won't need much waitin' on.""""Who is going to dress me?"" demanded Mary.Martha sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broadYorkshire in her amazement.""Canna' tha' dress thysen!"" she said.""What do you mean? I don't understand your language,"" said Mary.""Eh! I forgot,"" Martha said. ""Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to becareful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'. I mean can't you put onyour own clothes?""""No,"" answered Mary, quite indignantly. ""I never did in my life. My Ayahdressed me, of course.""""Well,"" said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she wasimpudent, ""it's time tha' should learn. Tha' cannot begin younger. It'lldo thee good to wait on thysen a bit. My mother always said she couldn'tsee why grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools—what withnurses an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as if they waspuppies!""""It is different in India,"" said Mistress Mary disdainfully. She couldscarcely stand this.But Martha was not at all crushed.""Eh! I can see it's different,"" she answered almost sympathetically. ""Idare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o'respectable white people. When I heard you was comin' from India Ithought you was a black too.""Mary sat up in bed furious.""What!"" she said. ""What! You thought I was a native. You—you daughterof a pig!""Martha stared and looked hot.""Who are you callin' names?"" she said. ""You needn't be so vexed. That'snot th' way for a young lady to talk. I've nothin' against th' blacks.When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious. Youalways read as a black's a man an' a brother. I've never seen a blackan' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close. When Icome in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an'pulled th' cover back careful to look at you. An' there you was,""disappointedly, ""no more black than me—for all you're so yeller.""Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.""You thought I was a native! You dared! You don't know anything aboutnatives! They are not people—they're servants who must salaam to you.You know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!""She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simplestare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far awayfrom everything she understood and which understood her, that she threwherself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was alittle frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bentover her.""Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!"" she begged. ""You mustn't forsure. I didn't know you'd be vexed. I don't know anythin' aboutanythin'—just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin'.""There was something comforting and really friendly in her queerYorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary. Shegradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved.""It's time for thee to get up now,"" she said. ""Mrs. Medlock said I wasto carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this.It's been made into a nursery for thee. I'll help thee on with thyclothes if tha'll get out o' bed. If th' buttons are at th' back tha'cannot button them up tha'self.""When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from thewardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the nightbefore with Mrs. Medlock.""Those are not mine,"" she said. ""Mine are black.""She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with coolapproval:""Those are nicer than mine.""""These are th' ones tha' must put on,"" Martha answered. ""Mr. Cravenordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London. He said 'I won't have a childdressed in black wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he said. 'It'd makethe place sadder than it is. Put color on her.' Mother she said she knewwhat he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She doesn't holdwith black hersel'.""""I hate black things,"" said Mary.The dressing process was one which taught them both something. Marthahad ""buttoned up"" her little sisters and brothers but she had never seena child who stood still and waited for another person to do things forher as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.""Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?"" she said when Mary quietlyheld out her foot.""My Ayah did it,"" answered Mary, staring. ""It was the custom.""She said that very often—""It was the custom."" The native servants werealways saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had notdone for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, ""It is notthe custom"" and one knew that was the end of the matter.It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything butstand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she wasready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at MisselthwaiteManor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new toher—things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and pickingup things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine younglady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful andwould have known that it was her business to brush hair, and buttonboots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only anuntrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottagewith a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed ofdoing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones whowere either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumbleover things.If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she wouldperhaps have laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, but Mary onlylistened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At firstshe was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on inher good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.""Eh! you should see 'em all,"" she said. ""There's twelve of us an' myfather only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother's putto it to get porridge for 'em all. They tumble about on th' moor an'play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em. Shesays she believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies do. OurDickon, he's twelve years old and he's got a young pony he calls hisown.""""Where did he get it?"" asked Mary.""He found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' hebegan to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck younggrass for it. And it got to like him so it follows him about an' itlets him get on its back. Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him.""Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thoughtshe should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon,and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself, itwas the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into the roomwhich had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was ratherlike the one she had slept in. It was not a child's room, but a grown-upperson's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oakchairs. A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast.But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked withsomething more than indifference at the first plate Martha set beforeher.""I don't want it,"" she said.""Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!"" Martha exclaimed incredulously.""No.""""Tha' doesn't know how good it is. Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bito' sugar.""""I don't want it,"" repeated Mary.""Eh!"" said Martha. ""I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste. Ifour children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes.""""Why?"" said Mary coldly.""Why!"" echoed Martha. ""Because they scarce ever had their stomachs fullin their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes.""""I don't know what it is to be hungry,"" said Mary, with the indifferenceof ignorance.Martha looked indignant.""Well, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,""she said outspokenly. ""I've no patience with folk as sits an' juststares at good bread an' meat. My word! don't I wish Dickon and Phil an'Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores.""""Why don't you take it to them?"" suggested Mary.""It's not mine,"" answered Martha stoutly. ""An' this isn't my day out. Iget my day out once a month same as th' rest. Then I go home an' cleanup for mother an' give her a day's rest.""Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.""You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,"" said Martha. ""It'll do yougood and give you some stomach for your meat.""Mary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, buteverything looked dull and wintry.""Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?""""Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'lt have to stay in, an' what has tha'got to do?""Mary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock hadprepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it wouldbe better to go and see what the gardens were like.""Who will go with me?"" she inquired.Martha stared.""You'll go by yourself,"" she answered. ""You'll have to learn to playlike other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers. OurDickon goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours. That's howhe made friends with th' pony. He's got sheep on th' moor that knowshim, an' birds as comes an' eats out of his hand. However little thereis to eat, he always saves a bit o' his bread to coax his pets.""It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out,though she was not aware of it. There would be birds outside thoughthere would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from thebirds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little bootsand she showed her her way down-stairs.""If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th' gardens,"" she said,pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. ""There's lots o' flowers insummer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now."" She seemed to hesitate asecond before she added, ""One of th' gardens is locked up. No one hasbeen in it for ten years.""""Why?"" asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked dooradded to the hundred in the strange house.""Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won't let noone go inside. It was her garden. He locked th' door an' dug a hole andburied th' key. There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing—I must run.""After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door inthe shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no onehad been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like andwhether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had passedthrough the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with widelawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were trees, andflower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a largepool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds werebare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not thegarden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up? You couldalways walk into a garden.She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path shewas following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was comingupon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in theivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden, evidently,and she could go into it.She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls allround it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemedto open into one another. She saw another open green door, revealingbushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables.Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of thebeds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly enough, Marythought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be nicer in summerwhen things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through thedoor leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he sawMary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did notseem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with hisgarden and wore her ""quite contrary"" expression, and certainly did notseem at all pleased to see him.""What is this place?"" she asked.""One o' th' kitchen-gardens,"" he answered.""What is that?"" said Mary, pointing through the other green door.""Another of 'em,"" shortly. ""There's another on t'other side o' th' wallan' there's th' orchard t'other side o' that.""""Can I go in them?"" asked Mary.""If tha' likes. But there's nowt to see.""Mary made no response. She went down the path and through the secondgreen door. There she found more walls and winter vegetables and glassframes, but in the second wall there was another green door and it wasnot open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for tenyears. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what shewanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. Shehoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she hadfound the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily and she walkedthrough it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all roundit also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-treesgrowing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to beseen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered theupper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem toend with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a placeat the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, andwhen she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting onthe topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his wintersong—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendlylittle whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable littlegirl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and bigbare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in theworld but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had beenused to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even thoughshe was ""Mistress Mary Quite Contrary"" she was desolate, and thebright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little facewhich was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He wasnot like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she shouldever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knewall about it.Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thoughtso much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted tosee what it was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If hehad liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered ifshe should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should notlike him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand andstare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully toask him why he had done such a queer thing.""People never like me and I never like people,"" she thought. ""And Inever can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talkingand laughing and making noises.""She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song ather, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rathersuddenly on the path.""I believe that tree was in the secret garden—I feel sure it was,"" shesaid. ""There was a wall round the place and there was no door.""She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and foundthe old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and watchedhim a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her andso at last she spoke to him.""I have been into the other gardens,"" she said.""There was nothin' to prevent thee,"" he answered crustily.""I went into the orchard.""""There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,"" he answered.""There was no door there into the other garden,"" said Mary.""What garden?"" he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for amoment.""The one on the other side of the wall,"" answered Mistress Mary. ""Thereare trees there—I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast wassitting on one of them and he sang.""To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed itsexpression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quitedifferent. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a personlooked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began towhistle—a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surlyman could make such a coaxing sound.Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a softlittle rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the redbreast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earthquite near to the gardener's foot.""Here he is,"" chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as ifhe were speaking to a child.""Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?"" he said. ""I've notseen thee before to-day. Has tha' begun tha' courtin' this early in th'season? Tha'rt too forrad.""The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with hissoft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiarand not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly,looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer feeling inher heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like aperson. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slenderdelicate legs.""Will he always come when you call him?"" she asked almost in a whisper.""Aye, that he will. I've knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. Hecome out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he flew overth' wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an' we gotfriendly. When he went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood wasgone an' he was lonely an' he come back to me.""""What kind of a bird is he?"" Mary asked.""Doesn't tha' know? He's a robin redbreast an' they're th' friendliest,curiousest birds alive. They're almost as friendly as dogs—if you knowhow to get on with 'em. Watch him peckin' about there an' lookin' roundat us now an' again. He knows we're talkin' about him.""It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He lookedat the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proudand fond of him.""He's a conceited one,"" he chuckled. ""He likes to hear folk talk abouthim. An' curious—bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an'meddlin'. He's always comin' to see what I'm plantin'. He knows all th'things Mester Craven never troubles hissel' to find out. He's th' headgardener, he is.""The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stoppedand looked at them a little. Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazedat her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding outall about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.""Where did the rest of the brood fly to?"" she asked.""There's no knowin'. The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it. This one was a knowin'one an' he knew he was lonely.""Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him veryhard.""I'm lonely,"" she said.She had not known before that this was one of the things which made herfeel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked ather and she looked at the robin.The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at hera minute.""Art tha' th' little wench from India?"" he asked.Mary nodded.""Then no wonder tha'rt lonely. Tha'lt be lonelier before tha's done,"" hesaid.He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black gardensoil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.""What is your name?"" Mary inquired.He stood up to answer her.""Ben Weatherstaff,"" he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle,""I'm lonely mysel' except when he's with me,"" and he jerked his thumbtoward the robin. ""He's th' only friend I've got.""""I have no friends at all,"" said Mary. ""I never had. My Ayah didn't likeme and I never played with any one.""It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, andold Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.""Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,"" he said. ""We was wove out of th'same cloth. We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us assour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'llwarrant.""This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth aboutherself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted toyou, whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, butshe wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she alsowondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came.She actually began to wonder also if she was ""nasty tempered."" She feltuncomfortable.Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turnedround. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robinhad flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of asong. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.""What did he do that for?"" asked Mary.""He's made up his mind to make friends with thee,"" replied Ben. ""Dang meif he hasn't took a fancy to thee.""""To me?"" said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly andlooked up.""Would you make friends with me?"" she said to the robin just as if shewas speaking to a person. ""Would you?"" And she did not say it either inher hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone sosoft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as shehad been when she heard him whistle.""Why,"" he cried out, ""tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was areal child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha' said it almost like Dickontalks to his wild things on th' moor.""""Do you know Dickon?"" Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.""Everybody knows him. Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere. Th' veryblackberries an' heather-bells knows him. I warrant th' foxes shows himwhere their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests fromhim.""Mary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost ascurious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just thatmoment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of hiswings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had otherthings to do.""He has flown over the wall!"" Mary cried out, watching him. ""He hasflown into the orchard—he has flown across the other wall—into thegarden where there is no door!""""He lives there,"" said old Ben. ""He came out o' th' egg there. If he'scourtin', he's makin' up to some young madam of a robin that lives amongth' old rose-trees there.""""Rose-trees,"" said Mary. ""Are there rose-trees?""Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.""There was ten year' ago,"" he mumbled.""I should like to see them,"" said Mary. ""Where is the green door? Theremust be a door somewhere.""Ben drove his spade deep and looked as uncompanionable as he had lookedwhen she first saw him.""There was ten year' ago, but there isn't now,"" he said.""No door!"" cried Mary. ""There must be.""""None as any one can find, an' none as is any one's business. Don't yoube a meddlesome wench an' poke your nose where it's no cause to go.Here, I must go on with my work. Get you gone an' play you. I've no moretime.""And he actually stopped digging, threw his spade over his shoulder andwalked off, without even glancing at her or saying good-by."

Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Marthakneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate herbreakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after eachbreakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor whichseemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after shehad stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she wouldhave to stay in and do nothing—and so she went out. She did not knowthat this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not knowthat, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths anddown the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herselfstronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. Sheran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed ather face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she couldnot see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heatherfilled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin bodyand whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyeswhen she did not know anything about it.But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened onemorning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to herbreakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push itaway, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating ituntil her bowl was empty.""Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?"" saidMartha.""It tastes nice to-day,"" said Mary, feeling a little surprised herself.""It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals,""answered Martha. ""It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well asappetite. There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an'nothin' to put in it. You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an'you'll get some flesh on your bones an' you won't be so yeller.""""I don't play,"" said Mary. ""I have nothing to play with.""""Nothin' to play with!"" exclaimed Martha. ""Our children plays withsticks and stones. They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things.""Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was nothing else todo. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the pathsin the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but thoughseveral times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or wastoo surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spadeand turned away as if he did it on purpose.One place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walkoutside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bareflower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves weremore bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time that part hadbeen neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat,but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff Mary stopped tonotice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and waslooking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw agleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top ofthe wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forwardto look at her with his small head on one side.""Oh!"" she cried out, ""is it you—is it you?"" And it did not seem at allqueer to her that she spoke to him as if she was sure that he wouldunderstand and answer her.He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as ifhe were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary asif she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It wasas if he said:""Good morning! Isn't the wind nice? Isn't the sun nice? Isn't everythingnice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come on!""Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along thewall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary—sheactually looked almost pretty for a moment.""I like you! I like you!"" she cried out, pattering down the walk; andshe chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to doin the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped andwhistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a dartingflight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had beenswinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the pathoutside a wall—much lower down—and there was the same tree inside.""It's in the garden no one can go into,"" she said to herself. ""It's thegarden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what itis like!""She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning.Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into theorchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on theother side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his songand beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.""It is the garden,"" she said. ""I am sure it is.""She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall,but she only found what she had found before—that there was no door init. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walkoutside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it andlooked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the otherend, looking again, but there was no door.""It's very queer,"" she said. ""Ben Weatherstaff said there was no doorand there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago,because Mr. Craven buried the key.""This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interestedand feel that she was not sorry that she had come to MisselthwaiteManor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care muchabout anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begunto blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little.She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to hersupper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did notfeel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather likedto hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. Sheasked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on thehearth-rug before the fire.""Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?"" she said.She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers andsisters, and she found it dull in the great servants' hall down-stairswhere the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speechand looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whisperedamong themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who hadlived in India, and been waited upon by ""blacks,"" was novelty enough toattract her.She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.""Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?"" she said. ""I knew tha' would.That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.""""Why did he hate it?"" Mary persisted.Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.""Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,"" she said. ""You couldbare stand up on the moor if you was out on it to-night.""Mary did not know what ""wutherin'"" meant until she listened, and thenshe understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar whichrushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see werebuffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safeand warm inside a room with a red coal fire.""But why did he hate it so?"" she asked, after she had listened. Sheintended to know if Martha did.Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.""Mind,"" she said, ""Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be talked about.There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over.That's Mr. Craven's orders. His troubles are none servants' business, hesays. But for th' garden he wouldn't be like he is. It was Mrs. Craven'sgarden that she had made when first they were married an' she just lovedit, an' they used to 'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' th'gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an' her used to go in an' shut th'door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' an' talkin'. An' she wasjust a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like aseat on it. An' she made roses grow over it an' she used to sit there.But one day when she was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she fell onth' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th' doctorsthought he'd go out o' his mind an' die, too. That's why he hates it. Noone's never gone in since, an' he won't let any one talk about it.""Mary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire andlistened to the wind ""wutherin'."" It seemed to be ""wutherin'"" louderthan ever.At that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good thingshad happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. Shehad felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understoodher; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she hadbeen healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had foundout what it was to be sorry for some one. She was getting on.But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to somethingelse. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcelydistinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound—it seemedalmost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind soundedrather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite surethat this sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away,but it was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.""Do you hear any one crying?"" she said.Martha suddenly looked confused.""No,"" she answered. ""It's th' wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if someone was lost on th' moor an' wailin'. It's got all sorts o' sounds.""""But listen,"" said Mary. ""It's in the house—down one of those longcorridors.""And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewheredown-stairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and thedoor of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as theyboth jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying soundwas swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainlythan ever.""There!"" said Mary. ""I told you so! It is some one crying—and it isn't agrown-up person.""Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did itthey both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with abang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased""wutherin'"" for a few moments.""It was th' wind,"" said Martha stubbornly. ""An' if it wasn't, it waslittle Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid. She's had th' toothache allday.""But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Marystare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth."

There could be no going out to-day.""What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?"" she askedMartha.""Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,"" Martha answered. ""Eh!there does seem a lot of us then. Mother's a good-tempered woman but shegets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and playsthere. Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet. He goes out just th' same as ifth' sun was shinin'. He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn'tshow when it's fair weather. He once found a little fox cub half drownedin its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep itwarm. Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an'th' rest o' th' litter was dead. He's got it at home now. He found ahalf-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an'tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' fliesabout with him everywhere.""The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiartalk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when shestopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah when shelived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about themoorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four littlerooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumbleabout and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured colliepuppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When Marthatold stories of what ""mother"" said or did they always soundedcomfortable.""If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,"" said Mary. ""But Ihave nothing.""Martha looked perplexed.""Can tha' knit?"" she asked.""No,"" answered Mary.""Can tha' sew?""""No.""""Can tha' read?""""Yes.""""Then why doesn't tha' read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'?Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now.""""I haven't any books,"" said Mary. ""Those I had were left in India.""""That's a pity,"" said Martha. ""If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th'library, there's thousands o' books there.""Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenlyinspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself.She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always tobe in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room down-stairs. In thisqueer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all. In fact, there was noone to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived aluxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung aboutwith shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where therewere four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great dealof lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no onetroubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and lookedat her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told herwhat to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way oftreating children. In India she had always been attended by her Ayah,who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She hadoften been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and waslearning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thoughtshe was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to herand put on.""Hasn't tha' got good sense?"" she said once, when Mary had stood waitingfor her to put on her gloves for her. ""Our Susan Ann is twice as sharpas thee an' she's only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks fair soft inth' head.""Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made herthink several entirely new things.She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Marthahad swept up the hearth for the last time and gone down-stairs. She wasthinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of thelibrary. She did not care very much about the library itself, becauseshe had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mindthe hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were allreally locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them.Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many doorsshe could count? It would be something to do on this morning when shecould not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission to dothings, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would nothave thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk aboutthe house, even if she had seen her.She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then shebegan her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into othercorridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted toothers again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on thewalls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, butoftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumesmade of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whosewalls were covered with these portraits. She had never thought therecould be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this place andstared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as ifthey were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in theirhouse. Some were pictures of children—little girls in thick satinfrocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boyswith puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffsaround their necks. She always stopped to look at the children, andwonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they woresuch odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little girl rather likeherself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on herfinger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.""Where do you live now?"" said Mary aloud to her. ""I wish you were here.""Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemedas if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own smallself, wandering about up-stairs and down, through narrow passages andwide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had everwalked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived inthem, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe ittrue.It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought ofturning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlockhad said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one ofthem and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she feltthat it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the dooritself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and openedinto a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall, andinlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room. Abroad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over themantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemedto stare at her more curiously than ever.""Perhaps she slept here once,"" said Mary. ""She stares at me so that shemakes me feel queer.""After that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms thatshe became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred,though she had not counted them. In all of them there were old picturesor old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were curiouspieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings wereall embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred littleelephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some hadtheir mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger thanthe others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary hadseen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She openedthe door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with thesefor quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants inorder and shut the door of the cabinet.In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms,she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Justafter she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, fromwhich it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion,and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the holepeeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to alittle gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion andmade a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep nearher. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there wereseven mice who did not look lonely at all.""If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me,"" saidMary.She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander anyfarther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way byturning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and downuntil she found the right one; but at last she reached her own flooragain, though she was some distance from her own room and did not knowexactly where she was.""I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,"" she said, standing stillat what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall. ""Idon't know which way to go. How still everything is!""It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this thatthe stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not quitelike the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, afretful, childish whine muffled by passing through walls.""It's nearer than it was,"" said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.""And it is crying.""She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and thensprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of adoor which fell open and showed her that there was another part of thecorridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch ofkeys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.""What are you doing here?"" she said, and she took Mary by the arm andpulled her away. ""What did I tell you?""""I turned round the wrong corner,"" explained Mary. ""I didn't know whichway to go and I heard some one crying.""She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more thenext.""You didn't hear anything of the sort,"" said the housekeeper. ""You comealong back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears.""And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up onepassage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her ownroom.""Now,"" she said, ""you stay where you're told to stay or you'll findyourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same ashe said he would. You're one that needs some one to look sharp afteryou. I've got enough to do.""She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary wentand sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but groundher teeth.""There was some one crying—there was—there was!"" she said toherself.She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She hadfound out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on along journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all thetime, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the graymouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion."

Look at the moor!""The rain-storm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been sweptaway in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and abrilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never hadMary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing; thiswas of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the watersof some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in thearched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. Thefar-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead ofgloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.""Aye,"" said Martha with a cheerful grin. ""Th' storm's over for a bit. Itdoes like this at this time o' th' year. It goes off in a night like itwas pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again.That's because th' springtime's on its way. It's a long way off yet, butit's comin'.""""I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,"" Marysaid.""Eh! no!"" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black leadbrushes. ""Nowt o' th' soart!""""What does that mean?"" asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spokedifferent dialects which only a few people understood, so she was notsurprised when Martha used words she did not know.Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.""There now,"" she said. ""I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs.Medlock said I mustn't. 'Nowt o' th' soart' means'nothin'-of-the-sort,'"" slowly and carefully, ""but it takes so long tosay it. Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I toldthee tha'd like th' moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see th'gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th'heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterfliesflutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'. You'llwant to get out on it at sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickondoes.""""Could I ever get there?"" asked Mary wistfully, looking through herwindow at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and sucha heavenly color.""I don't know,"" answered Martha. ""Tha's never used tha' legs since tha'was born, it seems to me. Tha' couldn't walk five mile. It's five mileto our cottage.""""I should like to see your cottage.""Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishingbrush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that the smallplain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done thefirst morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like little SusanAnn's when she wanted something very much.""I'll ask my mother about it,"" she said. ""She's one o' them that nearlyalways sees a way to do things. It's my day out to-day an' I'm goin'home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother. Perhaps shecould talk to her.""""I like your mother,"" said Mary.""I should think tha' did,"" agreed Martha, polishing away.""I've never seen her,"" said Mary.""No, tha' hasn't,"" replied Martha.She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with theback of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quitepositively.""Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin' an' good-natured an' cleanthat no one could help likin' her whether they'd seen her or not. WhenI'm goin' home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I'mcrossin' th' moor.""""I like Dickon,"" added Mary. ""And I've never seen him.""""Well,"" said Martha stoutly, ""I've told thee that th' very birds likeshim an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves.I wonder,"" staring at her reflectively, ""what Dickon would think ofthee?""""He wouldn't like me,"" said Mary in her stiff, cold little way. ""No onedoes.""Martha looked reflective again.""How does tha' like thysel'?"" she inquired, really quite as if she werecurious to know.Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.""Not at all—really,"" she answered. ""But I never thought of thatbefore.""Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.""Mother said that to me once,"" she said. ""She was at her wash-tub an' Iwas in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on mean' says: 'Tha' young vixon, tha'! There tha' stands sayin' tha'doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one. How does tha' likethysel'?' It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute.""She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary herbreakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to thecottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and dothe week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in thehouse. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and thefirst thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flowergarden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she hadfinished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole placelook different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite aswell as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up intoit, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of thelittle snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the firstkitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two othergardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. Hespoke to her of his own accord.""Springtime's comin',"" he said. ""Cannot tha' smell it?""Mary sniffed and thought she could.""I smell something nice and fresh and damp,"" she said.""That's th' good rich earth,"" he answered, digging away. ""It's in a goodhumor makin' ready to grow things. It's glad when plantin' time comes.It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do. In th' flower gardensout there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark. Th' sun'swarmin' 'em. You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' blackearth after a bit.""""What will they be?"" asked Mary.""Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys. Has tha' never seen them?""""No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,""said Mary. ""And I think things grow up in a night.""""These won't grow up in a night,"" said Weatherstaff. ""Tha'll have towait for 'em. They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spikemore there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that. You watch 'em.""""I am going to,"" answered Mary.Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knewat once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and lively, andhopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side andlooked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.""Do you think he remembers me?"" she said.""Remembers thee!"" said Weatherstaff indignantly. ""He knows every cabbagestump in th' gardens, let alone th' people. He's never seen a littlewench here before, an' he's bent on findin' out all about thee. Tha's noneed to try to hide anything from him.""""Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where helives?"" Mary inquired.""What garden?"" grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.""The one where the old rose-trees are."" She could not help asking,because she wanted so much to know. ""Are all the flowers dead, or dosome of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?""""Ask him,"" said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward therobin. ""He's the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it forten year'.""Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten yearsago.She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden justas she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother. Shewas beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people tolike—when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as oneof the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wallover which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walkedup and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, andit was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bareflower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending topeck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followedher. But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled herwith delight that she almost trembled a little.""You do remember me!"" she cried out. ""You do! You are prettier thananything else in the world!""She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tailand twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was likesatin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand andso pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important andlike a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that she hadever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer andcloser to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something likerobin sounds.Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him asthat! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her handtoward him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He knew it becausehe was a real person—only nicer than any other person in the world. Shewas so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because theperennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there weretall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, andas the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pileof freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a worm. Theearth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a moleand he had scratched quite a deep hole.Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as shelooked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It wassomething like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew upinto a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up. It wasmore than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it hadbeen buried a long time.Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened faceas it hung from her finger.""Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,"" she said in a whisper.""Perhaps it is the key to the garden!"""

She turned it over and over,and thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who hadbeen trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things. Allshe thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closedgarden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhapsopen it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to theold rose-trees. It was because it had been shut up so long that shewanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other placesand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shutthe door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and playit quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but wouldthink the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. Thethought of that pleased her very much.Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundredmysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuseherself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actuallyawakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong,pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it hadgiven her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood,so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always beentoo hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in thisplace she was beginning to care and to want to do new things. Alreadyshe felt less ""contrary,"" though she did not know why.She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No onebut herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and lookat the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was thebaffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing butthickly-growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very muchdisappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as shepaced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed sosilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. Shetook the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she madeup her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out,so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready.Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, butshe was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever andin the best of spirits.""I got up at four o'clock,"" she said. ""Eh! it was pretty on th' moorwith th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sunrisin'. I didn't walk all th' way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an'I can tell you I did enjoy myself.""She was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother hadbeen glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out ofthe way. She had even made each of the children a dough-cake with a bitof brown sugar in it.""I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in from playin' on th' moor.An' th' cottage all smelt o' nice, clean hot bakin' an' there was a goodfire, an' they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he said our cottage wasgood enough for a king to live in.""In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and hermother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Marthahad told them about the little girl who had come from India and who hadbeen waited on all her life by what Martha called ""blacks"" until shedidn't know how to put on her own stockings.""Eh! they did like to hear about you,"" said Martha. ""They wanted to knowall about th' blacks an' about th' ship you came in. I couldn't tell 'emenough.""Mary reflected a little.""I'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,"" she said,""so that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they would like tohear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers goingto hunt tigers.""""My word!"" cried delighted Martha. ""It would set 'em clean off theirheads. Would tha' really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild beastshow like we heard they had in York once.""""India is quite different from Yorkshire,"" Mary said slowly, as shethought the matter over. ""I never thought of that. Did Dickon and yourmother like to hear you talk about me?""""Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his head, they got thatround,"" answered Martha. ""But mother, she was put out about your seemin'to be all by yourself like. She said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got nogoverness for her, nor no nurse?' and I said, 'No, he hasn't, thoughMrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn'tthink of it for two or three years.'""""I don't want a governess,"" said Mary sharply.""But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book by this time an' youought to have a woman to look after you, an' she says: 'Now, Martha, youjust think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin'about all alone, an' no mother. You do your best to cheer her up,' shesays, an' I said I would.""Mary gave her a long, steady look.""You do cheer me up,"" she said. ""I like to hear you talk.""Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something heldin her hands under her apron.""What does tha' think,"" she said, with a cheerful grin. ""I've broughtthee a present.""""A present!"" exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full offourteen hungry people give any one a present!""A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin',"" Martha explained. ""An' hestopped his cart at our door. He had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends,but mother had no money to buy anythin'. Just as he was goin' away our'Lizabeth Ellen called out, 'Mother, he's got skippin'-ropes with redan' blue handles.' An' mother she calls out quite sudden, 'Here, stop,mister! How much are they?' An' he says 'Tuppence,' an' mother shebegan fumblin' in her pocket an' she says to me, 'Martha, tha's broughtme thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four places to put everypenny, but I'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child askippin'-rope,' an' she bought one an' here it is.""She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at eachend, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She gazed atit with a mystified expression.""What is it for?"" she asked curiously.""For!"" cried out Martha. ""Does tha' mean that they've not gotskippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and tigers andcamels! No wonder most of 'em's black. This is what it's for; just watchme.""And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in eachhand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chairto stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed tostare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottagerhad the impudence to be doing under their very noses. But Martha did noteven see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's facedelighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skippeduntil she had reached a hundred.""I could skip longer than that,"" she said when she stopped. ""I'veskipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn't as fatthen as I am now, an' I was in practice.""Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.""It looks nice,"" she said. ""Your mother is a kind woman. Do you think Icould ever skip like that?""""You just try it,"" urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope. ""Youcan't skip a hundred at first, but if you practise you'll mount up.That's what mother said. She says, 'Nothin' will do her more good thanskippin' rope. It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her playout in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her legs an' arms an'give her some strength in 'em.'""It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in MistressMary's arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not veryclever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.""Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o' doors,"" said Martha. ""Mothersaid I must tell you to keep out o' doors as much as you could, evenwhen it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm.""Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.She opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of somethingand turned back rather slowly.""Martha,"" she said, ""they were your wages. It was your twopence really.Thank you."" She said it stiffly because she was not used to thankingpeople or noticing that they did things for her. ""Thank you,"" she said,and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do.Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomedto this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.""Eh! tha' art a queer, old-womanish thing,"" she said. ""If tha'd been our'Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have give me a kiss.""Mary looked stiffer than ever.""Do you want me to kiss you?""Martha laughed again.""Nay, not me,"" she answered. ""If tha' was different, p'raps tha'd wantto thysel'. But tha' isn't. Run off outside an' play with thy rope.""Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzleto her. At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, andskipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was moreinterested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun wasshining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one whichcame in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newlyturned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up onewalk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden andsaw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hoppingabout him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his headand looked at her with a curious expression. She had wondered if hewould notice her. She really wanted him to see her skip.""Well!"" he exclaimed. ""Upon my word! P'raps tha' art a young 'un, afterall, an' p'raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins instead of sourbuttermilk. Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name's BenWeatherstaff. I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.""""I never skipped before,"" Mary said. ""I'm just beginning. I can only goup to twenty.""""Tha' keep on,"" said Ben. ""Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young 'unthat's lived with heathen. Just see how he's watchin' thee,"" jerking hishead toward the robin. ""He followed after thee yesterday. He'll be atit again to-day. He'll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is.He's never seen one. Eh!"" shaking his head at the bird, ""tha' curositywill be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp.""Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting everyfew minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up hermind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good longskip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down thepath she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She didnot mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stoppedwith a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robinswaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and he greeted herwith a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy inher pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robinshe laughed again.""You showed me where the key was yesterday,"" she said. ""You ought toshow me the door to-day; but I don't believe you know!""The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the walland he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to showoff. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin whenhe shows off—and they are nearly always doing it.Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah's stories,and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was astronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches ofthe trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailingsprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close tothe robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivytrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it inher hand. This she did because she had seen something under it—a roundknob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was theknob of a door.She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push themaside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swingingcurtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary's heart began tothump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement. Therobin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side,as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands whichwas square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she puther hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted thekeyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it,but it did turn.And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walkto see if any one was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come,it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not helpit, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back thedoor which opened slowly—slowly.Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with herback against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast withexcitement, and wonder, and delight.She was standing inside the secret garden."

The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leaflessstems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were mattedtogether. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a greatmany roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintrybrown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushesif they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had sospread their branches that they were like little trees. There were othertrees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place lookstrangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over themand swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and hereand there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch andhad crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges ofthemselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary didnot know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brownbranches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading overeverything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they hadfallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazytangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary hadthought it must be different from other gardens which had not been leftall by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any otherplace she had ever seen in her life.""How still it is!"" she whispered. ""How still!""Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, whohad flown to his tree-top, was still as all the rest. He did not evenflutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.""No wonder it is still,"" she whispered again. ""I am the first person whohas spoken in here for ten years.""She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraidof awakening some one. She was glad that there was grass under her feetand that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of thefairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays andtendrils which formed them.""I wonder if they are all quite dead,"" she said. ""Is it all a quite deadgarden? I wish it wasn't.""If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the woodwas alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were onlygray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even atiny leaf-bud anywhere.But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through thedoor under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world allher own.The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue skyover this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliantand soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from histree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another. Hechirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing herthings. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundredsof miles away from any one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roseswere dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leavesand buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a quitedead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it wouldbe, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after shehad walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the wholegarden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to havebeen grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there werealcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urnsin them.As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. Therehad once been a flower-bed in it, and she thought she saw somethingsticking out of the black earth—some sharp little pale green points.She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to lookat them.""Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses orsnowdrops or daffodils,"" she whispered.She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the dampearth. She liked it very much.""Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,"" she said.""I will go all over the garden and look.""She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on theground. She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and aftershe had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so manymore sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again.""It isn't a quite dead garden,"" she cried out softly to herself. ""Evenif the roses are dead, there are other things alive.""She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thickin some of the places where the green points were pushing their waythrough that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood andknelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she madenice little clear places around them.""Now they look as if they could breathe,"" she said, after she hadfinished with the first ones. ""I am going to do ever so many more. I'lldo all I can see. If I haven't time to-day I can come to-morrow.""She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself soimmensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass underthe trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coatoff, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on tothe grass and the pale green points all the time.The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to seegardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at BenWeatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things toeat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creaturewho was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into hisgarden and begin at once.Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her middaydinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put onher coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believethat she had been working two or three hours. She had been actuallyhappy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green pointswere to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they hadlooked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.""I shall come back this afternoon,"" she said, looking all round at hernew kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if theyheard her.Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door andslipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and suchbright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.""Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'!"" she said. ""Eh!mother will be pleased when I tell her what th' skippin'-rope's donefor thee.""In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary hadfound herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. Shehad put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on itand just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.""Martha,"" she said, ""what are those white roots that look like onions?""""They're bulbs,"" answered Martha. ""Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an' th' big ones arenarcissusis an' jonquils an' daffydowndillys. Th' biggest of all islilies an' purple flags. Eh! they are nice. Dickon's got a whole lot of'em planted in our bit o' garden.""""Does Dickon know all about them?"" asked Mary, a new idea takingpossession of her.""Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says hejust whispers things out o' th' ground.""""Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no onehelped them?"" inquired Mary anxiously.""They're things as helps themselves,"" said Martha. ""That's why poor folkcan afford to have 'em. If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'll workaway underground for a lifetime an' spread out an' have little 'uns.There's a place in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops bythousands. They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' springcomes. No one knows when they was first planted.""""I wish the spring was here now,"" said Mary. ""I want to see all thethings that grow in England.""She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on thehearth-rug.""I wish—I wish I had a little spade,"" she said.""Whatever does tha' want a spade for?"" asked Martha, laughing. ""Art tha'goin' to take to diggin'? I must tell mother that, too.""Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful ifshe meant to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn't doing any harm, but ifMr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry andget a new key and lock it up forevermore. She really could not bearthat.""This is such a big lonely place,"" she said slowly, as if she wereturning matters over in her mind. ""The house is lonely, and the park islonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I neverdid many things in India, but there were more people to look at—nativesand soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah toldme stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and BenWeatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won'tspeak to me often. I thought if I had a little spade I could digsomewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would giveme some seeds.""Martha's face quite lighted up.""There now!"" she exclaimed, ""if that wasn't one of th' things mothersaid. She says, 'There's such a lot o' room in that big place, why don'tthey give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn't plant nothin' butparsley an' radishes? She'd dig an' rake away an' be right down happyover it.' Them was the very words she said.""""Were they?"" said Mary. ""How many things she knows, doesn't she?""""Eh!"" said Martha. ""It's like she says: 'A woman as brings up twelvechildren learns something besides her A B C. Children's as good as'rithmetic to set you findin' out things.'""""How much would a spade cost—a little one?"" Mary asked.""Well,"" was Martha's reflective answer, ""at Thwaite village there's ashop or so an' I saw little garden sets with a spade an' a rake an' afork all tied together for two shillings. An' they was stout enough towork with, too.""""I've got more than that in my purse,"" said Mary. ""Mrs. Morrison gaveme five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.""""Did he remember thee that much?"" exclaimed Martha.""Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She givesme one every Saturday. I didn't know what to spend it on.""""My word! that's riches,"" said Martha. ""Tha' can buy anything in th'world tha' wants. Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an'it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it. Now I've just thought ofsomethin',"" putting her hands on her hips.""What?"" said Mary eagerly.""In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds for a pennyeach, and our Dickon he knows which is th' prettiest ones an' how tomake 'em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th' fun ofit. Does tha' know how to print letters?"" suddenly.""I know how to write,"" Mary answered.Martha shook her head.""Our Dickon can only read printin'. If tha' could print we could write aletter to him an' ask him to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seedsat th' same time.""""Oh! you're a good girl!"" Mary cried. ""You are, really! I didn't knowyou were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try. Let's ask Mrs.Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.""""I've got some of my own,"" said Martha. ""I bought 'em so I could print abit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I'll go and get it.""She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thinlittle hands together with sheer pleasure.""If I have a spade,"" she whispered, ""I can make the earth nice and softand dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the gardenwon't be dead at all—it will come alive.""She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returnedwith her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table andcarry the plates and dishes down-stairs and when she got into thekitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Marywaited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back. Then itwas a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taughtvery little because her governesses had disliked her too much to staywith her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that shecould print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictatedto her:""We'll put the money in th' envelope an' I'll get th' butcher's boy totake it in his cart. He's a great friend o' Dickon's,"" said Martha.""How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?"" asked Mary.""He'll bring 'em to you himself. He'll like to walk over this way.""""Oh!"" exclaimed Mary, ""then I shall see him! I never thought I shouldsee Dickon.""""Does tha' want to see him?"" asked Martha suddenly, she had looked sopleased.""Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see himvery much.""Martha gave a little start, as if she suddenly remembered something.""Now to think,"" she broke out, ""to think o' me forgettin' that there;an' I thought I was goin' to tell you first thing this mornin'. I askedmother—and she said she'd ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.""""Do you mean—"" Mary began.""What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottagesome day and have a bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' aglass o' milk.""It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day. Tothink of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!""Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?"" she asked, quiteanxiously.""Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is andhow clean she keeps the cottage.""""If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,"" said Mary,thinking it over and liking the idea very much. ""She doesn't seem to belike the mothers in India.""Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended bymaking her feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her untiltea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little. Butjust before Martha went down-stairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked aquestion.""Martha,"" she said, ""has the scullery-maid had the toothache againto-day?""Martha certainly started slightly.""What makes thee ask that?"" she said.""Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the doorand walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard thatfar-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn't awind to-day, so you see it couldn't have been the wind.""""Eh!"" said Martha restlessly. ""Tha' mustn't go walkin' about incorridors an' listenin'. Mr. Craven would be that there angry there's noknowin' what he'd do.""""I wasn't listening,"" said Mary. ""I was just waiting for you—and Iheard it. That's three times.""""My word! There's Mrs. Medlock's bell,"" said Martha, and she almost ranout of the room.""It's the strangest house any one ever lived in,"" said Mary drowsily, asshe dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel socomfortably tired that she fell asleep."

The SecretGarden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She likedthe name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautifulold walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost likebeing shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she hadread and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secretgardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in themfor a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. Shehad no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming widerawake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning to liketo be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. Shecould run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. Thebulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such niceclear places were made round them that they had all the breathing spacethey wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began tocheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The sun could getat them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach themat once, so they began to feel very much alive.Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had somethinginteresting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming morepleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed toher like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of thesprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemedto be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tinynew ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. Therewere so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the""snowdrops by the thousands,"" and about bulbs spreading and making newones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps theyhad spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long itwould be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes shestopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it wouldbe like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with BenWeatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start upbeside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she wasafraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming,so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But, in fact,he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he wassecretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company.Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know thatwhen she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to anative, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was notaccustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them todo things.""Tha'rt like th' robin,"" he said to her one morning when he lifted hishead and saw her standing by him. ""I never knows when I shall see theeor which side tha'll come from.""""He's friends with me now,"" said Mary.""That's like him,"" snapped Ben Weatherstaff. ""Makin' up to th' womenfolk just for vanity an' flightiness. There's nothin' he wouldn't do forth' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail-feathers. He's as full o'pride as an egg's full o' meat.""He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary'squestions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade whilehe looked her over.""How long has tha' been here?"" he jerked out.""I think it's about a month,"" she answered.""Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,"" he said. ""Tha's a bitfatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller. Tha' looked like ayoung plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden. Thinks I tomyself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un.""Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she wasnot greatly disturbed.""I know I'm fatter,"" she said. ""My stockings are getting tighter. Theyused to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.""There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever.His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings andtail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of livelygraces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. ButBen was sarcastic.""Aye, there tha' art!"" he said. ""Tha' can put up with me for a bitsometimes when tha's got no one better. Tha's been reddinin' up thywaistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha'sup to. Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere, tellin' thy liesto her about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready tofight all th' rest of 'em.""""Oh! look at him!"" exclaimed Mary.The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closerand closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. Heflew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang alittle song right at him.""Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,"" said Ben, wrinkling hisface up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to lookpleased. ""Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee—that's whattha' thinks.""The robin spread his wings—Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. Heflew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted onthe top of it. Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a newexpression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if hewould not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.He spoke quite in a whisper.""Well, I'm danged!"" he said as softly as if he were saying somethingquite different. ""Tha' does know how to get at a chap—tha' does! Tha'sfair unearthly, tha's so knowin'.""And he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—untilthe robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stoodlooking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, andthen he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was notafraid to talk to him.""Have you a garden of your own?"" she asked.""No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.""""If you had one,"" said Mary, ""what would you plant?""""Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions.""""But if you wanted to make a flower garden,"" persisted Mary, ""what wouldyou plant?""""Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things—but mostly roses.""Mary's face lighted up.""Do you like roses?"" she said.Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.""Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an' she loved 'em like theywas children—or robins. I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em."" Hedragged out another weed and scowled at it. ""That were as much as tenyear' ago.""""Where is she now?"" asked Mary, much interested.""Heaven,"" he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, ""'cordingto what parson says.""""What happened to the roses?"" Mary asked again, more interested thanever.""They was left to themselves.""Mary was becoming quite excited.""Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left tothemselves?"" she ventured.""Well, I'd got to like 'em—an' I liked her—an' she liked 'em,"" BenWeatherstaff admitted reluctantly. ""Once or twice a year I'd go an' workat 'em a bit—prune 'em an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but theywas in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.""""When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can youtell whether they are dead or alive?"" inquired Mary.""Wait till th' spring gets at 'em—wait till th' sun shines on th' rainan' th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out.""""How—how?"" cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.""Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' sees a bit of a brownlump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see whathappens."" He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.""Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?"" hedemanded.Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.""I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,"" she stammered.""I—there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing—and no one.""""Well,"" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, ""that's true.Tha' hasn't.""He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually alittle sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had onlyfelt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much.But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no onefound out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him asmany questions as she dared. He answered every one of them in his queergrunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up hisspade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she wasgoing away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fondof.""Do you go and see those other roses now?"" she asked.""Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints.""He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed toget angry with her, though she did not see why he should.""Now look here!"" he said sharply. ""Don't tha' ask so many questions.Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come across. Getthee gone an' play thee. I've done talkin' for to-day.""And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use instaying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk,thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here wasanother person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked oldBen Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try tomake him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everythingin the world about flowers.There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden andended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought shewould skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there wereany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and whenshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because sheheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what itwas.It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as shestopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his backagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boyabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheekswere as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round andsuch blue eyes in any boy's face. And on the trunk of the tree he leanedagainst, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behinda bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peepout, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing withtremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they were all drawingnear to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipeseemed to make.When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almostas low as and rather like his piping.""Don't tha' move,"" he said. ""It'd flight 'em.""Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to risefrom the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though hewere moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then thesquirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasantwithdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hopaway, though not at all as if they were frightened.""I'm Dickon,"" the boy said. ""I know tha'rt Miss Mary.""Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he wasDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as thenatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and hissmile spread all over his face.""I got up slow,"" he explained, ""because if tha' makes a quick move itstartles 'em. A body 'as to move gentle an' speak low when wild thingsis about.""He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before butas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoketo him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.""Did you get Martha's letter?"" she asked.He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.""That's why I come.""He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the groundbeside him when he piped.""I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an' rake an' a forkan' hoe. Eh! they are good 'uns. There's a trowel, too. An' th' woman inth' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur whenI bought th' other seeds.""""Will you show the seeds to me?"" Mary said.She wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy.It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would notlike him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes andwith a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to himshe noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass andleaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She liked it verymuch and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks andround blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.""Let us sit down on this log and look at them,"" she said.They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of hiscoat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so manyneater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.""There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,"" he said. ""Mignonette's th'sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it,same as poppies will. Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistleto 'em, them's th' nicest of all.""He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lightingup.""Where's that robin as is callin' us?"" he said.The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, andMary thought she knew whose it was.""Is it really calling us?"" she asked.""Aye,"" said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,""he's callin' some one he's friends with. That's same as sayin' 'Here Iam. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.' There he is in the bush. Whoseis he?""""He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he knows me a little,"" answeredMary.""Aye, he knows thee,"" said Dickon in his low voice again. ""An' he likesthee. He's took thee on. He'll tell me all about thee in a minute.""He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticedbefore, and then he made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter.The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite asif he were replying to a question.""Aye, he's a friend o' yours,"" chuckled Dickon.""Do you think he is?"" cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. ""Doyou think he really likes me?""""He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,"" answered Dickon. ""Birds israre choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he'smaking up to thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'.""And it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twitteredand tilted as he hopped on his bush.""Do you understand everything birds say?"" said Mary.Dickon's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, andhe rubbed his rough head.""I think I do, and they think I do,"" he said. ""I've lived on th' moorwith 'em so long. I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledgean' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I think I'm one of 'em.Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or asquirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it.""He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flowerseeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers;he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.""See here,"" he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. ""I'll plantthem for thee myself. Where is tha' garden?""Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She didnot know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She hadnever thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she wentred and then pale.""Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?"" Dickon said.It was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do it,and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.""Wouldn't they give thee a bit?"" he asked. ""Hasn't tha' got any yet?""She held her hands even tighter and turned her eyes toward him.""I don't know anything about boys,"" she said slowly. ""Could you keep asecret, if I told you one? It's a great secret. I don't know what Ishould do if any one found it out. I believe I should die!"" She said thelast sentence quite fiercely.Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over hisrough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.""I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,"" he said. ""If I couldn't keep secretsfrom th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an'wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor. Aye, I can keepsecrets.""Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve butshe did it.""I've stolen a garden,"" she said very fast. ""It isn't mine. It isn'tanybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes intoit. Perhaps everything is dead in it already; I don't know.""She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.""I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right to take it from mewhen I care about it and they don't. They're letting it die, all shut inby itself,"" she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her faceand burst out crying—poor little Mistress Mary.Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.""Eh-h-h!"" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way hedid it meant both wonder and sympathy.""I've nothing to do,"" said Mary. ""Nothing belongs to me. I found itmyself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, andthey wouldn't take it from the robin.""""Where is it?"" asked Dickon in a dropped voice.Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contraryagain, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious andIndian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.""Come with me and I'll show you,"" she said.She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew sothickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on hisface. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird'snest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted thehanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly openand they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her handround defiantly.""It's this,"" she said. ""It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one inthe world who wants it to be alive.""Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.""Eh!"" he almost whispered, ""it is a queer, pretty place! It's like as ifa body was in a dream."""

I forgot!"" said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her handquickly against her mouth. ""Did you know about the garden?"" she askedagain when she had recovered herself.Dickon nodded.""Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,"" he answered.""Us used to wonder what it was like.""He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and hisround eyes looked queerly happy.""Eh! the nests as'll be here come springtime,"" he said. ""It'd be th'safest nestin' place in England. No one never comin' near an' tangles o'trees an' roses to build in. I wonder all th' birds on th' moor don'tbuild here.""Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.""Will there be roses?"" she whispered. ""Can you tell? I thought perhapsthey were all dead.""""Eh! No! Not them—not all of 'em!"" he answered. ""Look here!""He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichenall over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays andbranches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of itsblades.""There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut out,"" he said. ""An'there's a lot o' old wood, but it made some new last year. This here's anew bit,"" and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead ofhard, dry gray.Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.""That one?"" she said. ""Is that one quite alive—quite?""Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.""It's as wick as you or me,"" he said; and Mary remembered that Marthahad told her that ""wick"" meant ""alive"" or ""lively.""""I'm glad it's wick!"" she cried out in her whisper. ""I want them all tobe wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones thereare.""She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was.They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried hisknife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.""They've run wild,"" he said, ""but th' strongest ones has fair thrived onit. The delicatest ones has died out, but th' others has growed an'growed, an' spread an' spread, till they's a wonder. See here!"" and hepulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. ""A body might think thiswas dead wood, but I don't believe it is—down to th' root. I'll cut itlow down an' see.""He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, notfar above the earth.""There!"" he said exultantly. ""I told thee so. There's green in thatwood yet. Look at it.""Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.""When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that, it's wick,"" heexplained. ""When th' inside is dry an' breaks easy, like this here pieceI've cut off, it's done for. There's a big root here as all this livewood sprung out of, an' if th' old wood's cut off an' it's dug round,an' took care of there'll be—"" he stopped and lifted his face to lookup at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—""there'll be a fountaino' roses here this summer.""They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strongand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead woodaway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still greenlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could telltoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry outjoyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade ofmoist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He showedher how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade andstirred the earth and let the air in.They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roseswhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation ofsurprise.""Why!"" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. ""Who did thatthere?""It was one of Mary's own little clearings round the pale green points.""I did it,"" said Mary.""Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin',"" he exclaimed.""I don't,"" she answered, ""but they were so little, and the grass was sothick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. SoI made a place for them. I don't even know what they are.""Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.""Tha' was right,"" he said. ""A gardener couldn't have told thee better.They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk. They're crocuses an' snowdrops,an' these here is narcissuses,"" turning to another patch, ""an' here'sdaffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.""He ran from one clearing to another.""Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a little wench,"" he said, lookingher over.""I'm growing fatter,"" said Mary, ""and I'm growing stronger. I usedalways to be tired. When I dig I'm not tired at all. I like to smellthe earth when it's turned up.""""It's rare good for thee,"" he said, nodding his head wisely. ""There'snaught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o'fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em. I get out on th' moormany a day when it's rainin' an' I lie under a bush an' listen to th'soft swish o' drops on th' heather an' I just sniff an' sniff. My noseend fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says.""""Do you never catch cold?"" inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly. Shehad never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.""Not me,"" he said, grinning. ""I never ketched cold since I was born. Iwasn't brought up nesh enough. I've chased about th' moor in allweathers same as th' rabbits does. Mother says I've sniffed up too muchfresh air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with cold. I'm astough as a white-thorn knobstick.""He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following himand helping him with her fork or the trowel.""There's a lot of work to do here!"" he said once, looking about quiteexultantly.""Will you come again and help me to do it?"" Mary begged. ""I'm sure I canhelp, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me.Oh! do come, Dickon!""""I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or shine,"" he answeredstoutly. ""It's th' best fun I ever had in my life—shut in here an'wakenin' up a garden.""""If you will come,"" said Mary, ""if you will help me to make it aliveI'll—I don't know what I'll do,"" she ended helplessly. What could youdo for a boy like that?""I'll tell thee what tha'll do,"" said Dickon, with his happy grin.""Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an' tha'll learnhow to talk to th' robin same as I do. Eh! we'll have a lot o' fun.""He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls andbushes with a thoughtful expression.""I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's garden, all clippedan' spick an' span, would you?"" he said. ""It's nicer like this withthings runnin' wild, an' swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.""""Don't let us make it tidy,"" said Mary anxiously. ""It wouldn't seem likea secret garden if it was tidy.""Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.""It's a secret garden sure enough,"" he said, ""but seems like some onebesides th' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year'ago.""""But the door was locked and the key was buried,"" said Mary. ""No onecould get in.""""That's true,"" he answered. ""It's a queer place. Seems to me as ifthere'd been a bit o' prunin' done here an' there, later than ten year'ago.""""But how could it have been done?"" said Mary.He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.""Aye! how could it!"" he murmured. ""With th' door locked an' th' keyburied.""Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she shouldnever forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Ofcourse, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickonbegan to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sungat her when he wanted to tease her.""Are there any flowers that look like bells?"" she inquired.""Lilies o' th' valley does,"" he answered, digging away with the trowel,""an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.""""Let us plant some,"" said Mary.""There's lilies o' th' valley here already; I saw 'em. They'll havegrowed too close an' we'll have to separate 'em, but there's plenty. Th'other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you somebits o' plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha' want 'em?""Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India andof how she had hated them and of their calling her ""Mistress Mary QuiteContrary.""""They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowerslike silver bells.""She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into theearth.""I wasn't as contrary as they were.""But Dickon laughed.""Eh!"" he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he wassniffing up the scent of it, ""there doesn't seem to be no need for noone to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like, an' such lots o'friendly wild things runnin' about makin' homes for themselves, orbuildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin', does there?""Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stoppedfrowning.""Dickon,"" she said. ""You are as nice as Martha said you were. I likeyou, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like fivepeople.""Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing thegrate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his roundblue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.""Only five folk as tha' likes?"" he said. ""Who is th' other four?""""Your mother and Martha,"" Mary checked them off on her fingers, ""and therobin and Ben Weatherstaff.""Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting hisarm over his mouth.""I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,"" he said, ""but I think tha' art th'queerest little lass I ever saw.""Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him aquestion she had never dreamed of asking any one before. And she triedto ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India anative was always pleased if you knew his speech.""Does tha' like me?"" she said.""Eh!"" he answered heartily, ""that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an' sodoes th' robin, I do believe!""""That's two, then,"" said Mary. ""That's two for me.""And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary wasstartled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strikethe hour of her midday dinner.""I shall have to go,"" she said mournfully. ""And you will have to go too,won't you?""Dickon grinned.""My dinner's easy to carry about with me,"" he said. ""Mother always letsme put a bit o' somethin' in my pocket.""He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpylittle bundle tied up in a quiet clean, coarse, blue and whitehandkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice ofsomething laid between them.""It's oftenest naught but bread,"" he said, ""but I've got a fine slice o'fat bacon with it to-day.""Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.""Run on an' get thy victuals,"" he said. ""I'll be done with mine first.I'll get some more work done before I start back home.""He sat down with his back against a tree.""I'll call th' robin up,"" he said, ""and give him th' rind o' th' baconto peck at. They likes a bit o' fat wonderful.""Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he mightbe a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the gardenagain. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to thedoor in the wall and then she stopped and went back.""Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?"" she said.His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of breadand bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.""If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha'think I'd tell any one? Not me,"" he said. ""Tha' art as safe as a misselthrush.""And she was quite sure she was."

Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were brightpink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting nearit.""Tha's a bit late,"" she said. ""Where has tha' been?""""I've seen Dickon!"" said Mary. ""I've seen Dickon!""""I knew he'd come,"" said Martha exultantly. ""How does tha' like him?""""I think—I think he's beautiful!"" said Mary in a determined voice.Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.""Well,"" she said, ""he's th' best lad as ever was born, but us neverthought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.""""I like it to turn up,"" said Mary.""An' his eyes is so round,"" said Martha, a trifle doubtful. ""Thoughthey're a nice color.""""I like them round,"" said Mary. ""And they are exactly the color of thesky over the moor.""Martha beamed with satisfaction.""Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin' up at th' birdsan' th' clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?""""I love his big mouth,"" said Mary obstinately. ""I wish mine were justlike it.""Martha chuckled delightedly.""It'd look rare an' funny in thy bit of a face,"" she said. ""But I knowedit would be that way when tha' saw him. How did tha' like th' seeds an'th' garden tools?""""How did you know he brought them?"" asked Mary.""Eh! I never thought of him not bringin' 'em. He'd be sure to bring 'emif they was in Yorkshire. He's such a trusty lad.""Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but shedid not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools,and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was whenshe began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.""Who did tha' ask about it?"" she inquired.""I haven't asked anybody yet,"" said Mary, hesitating.""Well, I wouldn't ask th' head gardener. He's too grand, Mr. Roach is.""""I've never seen him,"" said Mary. ""I've only seen under-gardeners andBen Weatherstaff.""""If I was you, I'd ask Ben Weatherstaff,"" advised Martha. ""He's not halfas bad as he looks, for all he's so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him do whathe likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an' he used tomake her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he'd find you a corner somewhereout o' the way.""""If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind myhaving it, could they?"" Mary said anxiously.""There wouldn't be no reason,"" answered Martha. ""You wouldn't do noharm.""Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from thetable she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, butMartha stopped her.""I've got somethin' to tell you,"" she said. ""I thought I'd let you eatyour dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin' and I think hewants to see you.""Mary turned quite pale.""Oh!"" she said. ""Why! Why! He didn't want to see me when I came. I heardPitcher say he didn't.""""Well,"" explained Martha, ""Mrs. Medlock says it's because o' mother. Shewas walkin' to Thwaite village an' she met him. She'd never spoke to himbefore, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times. He'dforgot, but mother hadn't an' she made bold to stop him. I don't knowwhat she said to him about you but she said somethin' as put him in th'mind to see you before he goes away again, to-morrow.""""Oh!"" cried Mary, ""is he going away to-morrow? I am so glad!""""He's goin' for a long time. He mayn't come back till autumn or winter.He's goin' to travel in foreign places. He's always doin' it.""""Oh! I'm so glad—so glad!"" said Mary thankfully.If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would betime to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out thenand took it away from her she would have had that much at least.""When do you think he will want to see—""She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs.Medlock walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and hercollar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man's faceon it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died yearsago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervousand excited.""Your hair's rough,"" she said quickly. ""Go and brush it. Martha, helpher to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him inhis study.""All the pink left Mary's cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she feltherself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did noteven answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom,followed by Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, andher hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Medlockdown the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say? She wasobliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and shewould not like him. She knew what he would think of her.She was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. Atlast Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when some one said, ""Come in,""they entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair beforethe fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.""This is Miss Mary, sir,"" she said.""You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you totake her away,"" said Mr. Craven.When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, aplain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see thatthe man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high,rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white. Heturned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.""Come here!"" he said.Mary went to him.He was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been somiserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him andas if he did not know what in the world to do with her.""Are you well?"" he asked.""Yes,"" answered Mary.""Do they take good care of you?""""Yes.""He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.""You are very thin,"" he said.""I am getting fatter,"" Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffestway.What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcelysaw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keephis thoughts upon her.""I forgot you,"" he said. ""How could I remember you? I intended to sendyou a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.""""Please,"" began Mary. ""Please—"" and then the lump in her throat chokedher.""What do you want to say?"" he inquired.""I am—I am too big for a nurse,"" said Mary. ""And please—please don'tmake me have a governess yet.""He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.""That was what the Sowerby woman said,"" he muttered absent-mindedly.Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.""Is she—is she Martha's mother?"" she stammered.""Yes, I think so,"" he replied.""She knows about children,"" said Mary. ""She has twelve. She knows.""He seemed to rouse himself.""What do you want to do?""""I want to play out of doors,"" Mary answered, hoping that her voice didnot tremble. ""I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and Iam getting fatter.""He was watching her.""Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,"" he said. ""Shethought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.""""It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,""argued Mary.""Where do you play?"" he asked next.""Everywhere,"" gasped Mary. ""Martha's mother sent me a skipping-rope. Iskip and run—and I look about to see if things are beginning to stickup out of the earth. I don't do any harm.""""Don't look so frightened,"" he said in a worried voice. ""You could notdo any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.""Mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might seethe excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer tohim.""May I?"" she said tremulously.Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.""Don't look so frightened,"" he exclaimed. ""Of course you may. I am yourguardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you timeor attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish youto be happy and comfortable. I don't know anything about children, butMrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you to-daybecause Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talkedabout you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and runningabout.""""She knows all about children,"" Mary said again in spite of herself.""She ought to,"" said Mr. Craven. ""I thought her rather bold to stop meon the moor, but she said—Mrs. Craven had been kind to her."" It seemedhard for him to speak his dead wife's name. ""She is a respectable woman.Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out of doorsas much as you like. It's a big place and you may go where you like andamuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?"" as if a suddenthought had struck him. ""Do you want toys, books, dolls?""""Might I,"" quavered Mary, ""might I have a bit of earth?""In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound andthat they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Craven lookedquite startled.""Earth!"" he repeated. ""What do you mean?""""To plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive,"" Maryfaltered.He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over hiseyes.""Do you—care about gardens so much,"" he said slowly.""I didn't know about them in India,"" said Mary. ""I was always ill andtired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand andstuck flowers in them. But here it is different.""Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.""A bit of earth,"" he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow shemust have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to herhis dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.""You can have as much earth as you want,"" he said. ""You remind me ofsome one else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see abit of earth you want,"" with something like a smile, ""take it, child,and make it come alive.""""May I take it from anywhere—if it's not wanted?""""Anywhere,"" he answered. ""There! You must go now, I am tired."" Hetouched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. ""Good-by. I shall be away allsummer.""Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have beenwaiting in the corridor.""Mrs. Medlock,"" Mr. Craven said to her, ""now I have seen the child Iunderstand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before shebegins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in thegarden. Don't look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh airand romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then andshe may sometimes go to the cottage.""Mrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not""look after"" Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and hadindeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she wasfond of Martha's mother.""Thank you, sir,"" she said. ""Susan Sowerby and me went to schooltogether and she's as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you'd find ina day's walk. I never had any children myself and she's had twelve, andthere never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm fromthem. I'd always take Susan Sowerby's advice about children myself.She's what you might call healthy-minded—if you understand me.""""I understand,"" Mr. Craven answered. ""Take Miss Mary away now and sendPitcher to me.""When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew backto her room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact,hurried back after she had removed the dinner service.""I can have my garden!"" cried Mary. ""I may have it where I like! I amnot going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming tosee me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me couldnot do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!""""Eh!"" said Martha delightedly, ""that was nice of him wasn't it?""""Martha,"" said Mary solemnly, ""he is really a nice man, only his face isso miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.""She ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so muchlonger than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have toset out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through the doorunder the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him. Thegardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to them,looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen. He hadgone away and the secret garden was empty—except for the robin who hadjust flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watchingher.""He's gone,"" she said wofully. ""Oh! was he—was he—was he only a woodfairy?""Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. Itwas a piece of paper—in fact, it was a piece of the letter she hadprinted for Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with along thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. Therewere some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture. At firstshe could not tell what it was. Then she saw it was meant for a nestwith a bird sitting on it. Underneath were the printed letters and theysaid:""I will cum bak."""

""I never knew our Dickon was asclever as that. That there's a picture of a missel thrush on her nest,as large as life an' twice as natural.""Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He hadmeant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden washer nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like thatqueer, common boy!She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleeplooking forward to the morning.But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularlyin the springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rainbeating with heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down intorrents and the wind was ""wuthering"" round the corners and in thechimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserableand angry.""The rain is as contrary as I ever was,"" she said. ""It came because itknew I did not want it.""She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did notcry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, shehated the wind and its ""wuthering."" She could not go to sleep again. Themournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If shehad felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it""wuthered"" and how the big rain-drops poured down and beat against thepane!""It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and oncrying,"" she said.She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour,when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head towardthe door listening. She listened and she listened.""It isn't the wind now,"" she said in a loud whisper. ""That isn't thewind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.""The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, afar-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutesand each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she mustfind out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden andthe buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood madeher bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.""I am going to find out what it is,"" she said. ""Everybody is in bed andI don't care about Mrs. Medlock—I don't care!""There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly outof the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was tooexcited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she mustturn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry—theone Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself. The soundhad come up that passage. So she went on with her dim light, almostfeeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she couldhear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led her. Sometimes itstopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this the rightcorner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this passageand then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the rightagain. Yes, there was the tapestry door.She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stoodin the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it wasnot loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a fewyards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of lightcoming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it wasquite a young Someone.So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standingin the room!It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was alow fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by theside of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed waslying a boy, crying fretfully.Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleepagain and was dreaming without knowing it.The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed tohave eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled overhis forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. Helooked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he weretired and cross than as if he were in pain.Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding herbreath. Then she crept across the room, and as she drew nearer thelight attracted the boy's attention and he turned his head on his pillowand stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemedimmense.""Who are you?"" he said at last in a half-frightened whisper. ""Are you aghost?""""No, I am not,"" Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half frightened.""Are you one?""He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing whatstrange eyes he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big forhis face because they had black lashes all round them.""No,"" he replied after waiting a moment or so. ""I am Colin.""""Who is Colin?"" she faltered.""I am Colin Craven. Who are you?""""I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.""""He is my father,"" said the boy.""Your father!"" gasped Mary. ""No one ever told me he had a boy! Whydidn't they?""""Come here,"" he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her withan anxious expression.She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.""You are real, aren't you?"" he said. ""I have such real dreams veryoften. You might be one of them.""Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and sheput a piece of it between his fingers.""Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,"" she said. ""I will pinch youa little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I thoughtyou might be a dream too.""""Where did you come from?"" he asked.""From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn't go to sleep and Iheard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were youcrying for?""""Because I couldn't go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me yourname again.""""Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?""He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look alittle more as if he believed in her reality.""No,"" he answered. ""They daren't.""""Why?"" asked Mary.""Because I should have been afraid you would see me. I won't let peoplesee me and talk me over.""""Why?"" Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.""Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My fatherwon't let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed tospeak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan't live. Myfather hates to think I may be like him.""""Oh, what a queer house this is!"" Mary said. ""What a queer house!Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens arelocked up—and you! Have you been locked up?""""No. I stay in this room because I don't want to be moved out of it. Ittires me too much.""""Does your father come and see you?"" Mary ventured.""Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn't want to see me.""""Why?"" Mary could not help asking again.A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy's face.""My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me.He thinks I don't know, but I've heard people talking. He almost hatesme.""""He hates the garden, because she died,"" said Mary half speaking toherself.""What garden?"" the boy asked.""Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,"" Mary stammered. ""Have youbeen here always?""""Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside,but I won't stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an ironthing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London tosee me and said it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep meout in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don't want to go out.""""I didn't when first I came here,"" said Mary. ""Why do you keep lookingat me like that?""""Because of the dreams that are so real,"" he answered rather fretfully.""Sometimes when I open my eyes I don't believe I'm awake.""""We're both awake,"" said Mary. She glanced round the room with its highceiling and shadowy corners and dim firelight. ""It looks quite like adream, and it's the middle of the night, and everybody in the house isasleep—everybody but us. We are wide awake.""""I don't want it to be a dream,"" the boy said restlessly.Mary thought of something all at once.""If you don't like people to see you,"" she began, ""do you want me to goaway?""He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.""No,"" he said. ""I should be sure you were a dream if you went. If youare real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear aboutyou.""Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on thecushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stayin the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.""What do you want me to tell you?"" she said.He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted toknow which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had beendoing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had livedbefore she came to Yorkshire. She answered all these questions and manymore and he lay back on his pillow and listened. He made her tell him agreat deal about India and about her voyage across the ocean. She foundout that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things asother children had. One of his nurses had taught him to read when he wasquite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures insplendid books.Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given allsorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to havebeen amused, however. He could have anything he asked for and was nevermade to do anything he did not like to do.""Every one is obliged to do what pleases me,"" he said indifferently. ""Itmakes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.""He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased tomatter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary's voice. Asshe went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once ortwice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But atlast he asked a question which opened up a new subject.""How old are you?"" he asked.""I am ten,"" answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, ""and soare you.""""How do you know that?"" he demanded in a surprised voice.""Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key wasburied. And it has been locked for ten years.""Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.""What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried?"" heexclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.""It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,"" said Mary nervously. ""Helocked the door. No one—no one knew where he buried the key.""""What sort of a garden is it?"" Colin persisted eagerly.""No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,"" was Mary'scareful answer.But it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He toohad had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attractedhim as it had attracted her. He asked question after question. Where wasit? Had she never looked for the door? Had she never asked thegardeners?""They won't talk about it,"" said Mary. ""I think they have been told notto answer questions.""""I would make them,"" said Colin.""Could you?"" Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he couldmake people answer questions, who knew what might happen!""Every one is obliged to please me. I told you that,"" he said. ""If Iwere to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all knowthat. I would make them tell me.""Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could seequite plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that thewhole world belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spokeof not living.""Do you think you won't live?"" she asked, partly because she wascurious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.""I don't suppose I shall,"" he answered as indifferently as he had spokenbefore. ""Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say Ishan't. At first they thought I was too little to understand and nowthey think I don't hear. But I do. My doctor is my father's cousin. Heis quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my fatheris dead. I should think he wouldn't want me to live.""""Do you want to live?"" inquired Mary.""No,"" he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. ""But I don't want to die.When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.""""I have heard you crying three times,"" Mary said, ""but I did not knowwho it was. Were you crying about that?"" She did so want him to forgetthe garden.""I dare say,"" he answered. ""Let us talk about something else. Talk aboutthat garden. Don't you want to see it?""""Yes,"" answered Mary, in quite a low voice.""I do,"" he went on persistently. ""I don't think I ever really wanted tosee anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dugup. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in mychair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them openthe door.""He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine likestars and looked more immense than ever.""They have to please me,"" he said. ""I will make them take me there and Iwill let you go, too.""Mary's hands clutched each other. Everything would bespoiled—everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never againfeel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.""Oh, don't—don't—don't—don't do that!"" she cried out.He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!""Why?"" he exclaimed. ""You said you wanted to see it.""""I do,"" she answered almost with a sob in her throat, ""but if you makethem open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secretagain.""He leaned still farther forward.""A secret,"" he said. ""What do you mean? Tell me.""Mary's words almost tumbled over one another.""You see—you see,"" she panted, ""if no one knows but ourselves—if therewas a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if there was—and we couldfind it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behindus, and no one knew any one was inside and we called it our garden andpretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and ifwe played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made itall come alive—""""Is it dead?"" he interrupted her.""It soon will be if no one cares for it,"" she went on. ""The bulbs willlive but the roses—""He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.""What are bulbs?"" he put in quickly.""They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in theearth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.""""Is the spring coming?"" he said. ""What is it like? You don't see it inrooms if you are ill.""""It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine,and things pushing up and working under the earth,"" said Mary. ""If thegarden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the thingsgrow bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive. Don't you see?Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?""He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression onhis face.""I never had a secret,"" he said, ""except that one about not living togrow up. They don't know I know that, so it is a sort of secret. But Ilike this kind better.""""If you won't make them take you to the garden,"" pleaded Mary,""perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime. Andthen—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you canalways do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find some boywho would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be asecret garden.""""I should—like—that,"" he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy. ""Ishould like that. I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.""Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea ofkeeping the secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that ifshe kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as shehad seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to thinkthat everybody might tramp into it when they chose.""I'll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could go into it,""she said. ""It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangleperhaps.""He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about theroses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hungdown—about the many birds which might have built their nests therebecause it was so safe. And then she told him about the robin and BenWeatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it wasso easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to feel afraid. Therobin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almostbeautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer thanherself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.""I did not know birds could be like that,"" he said. ""But if you stay ina room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as ifyou had been inside that garden.""She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidentlydid not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.""I am going to let you look at something,"" he said. ""Do you see thatrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?""Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was acurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.""Yes,"" she answered.""There is a cord hanging from it,"" said Colin. ""Go and pull it.""Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it thesilk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered apicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She hadbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes wereexactly like Colin's unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as bigas they really were because of the black lashes all round them.""She is my mother,"" said Colin complainingly. ""I don't see why she died.Sometimes I hate her for doing it.""""How queer!"" said Mary.""If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,"" hegrumbled. ""I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would nothave hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back.Draw the curtain again.""Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.""She is much prettier than you,"" she said, ""but her eyes are just likeyours—at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the curtaindrawn over her?""He moved uncomfortably.""I made them do it,"" he said. ""Sometimes I don't like to see her lookingat me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable. Besides, she ismine and I don't want every one to see her.""There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.""What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?"" sheinquired.""She would do as I told her to do,"" he answered. ""And I should tell herthat I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am glad youcame.""""So am I,"" said Mary. ""I will come as often as I can, but""—shehesitated—""I shall have to look every day for the garden door.""""Yes, you must,"" said Colin, ""and you can tell me about it afterward.""He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spokeagain.""I think you shall be a secret, too,"" he said. ""I will not tell themuntil they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and saythat I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?""""Yes, I know her very well,"" said Mary. ""She waits on me.""He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.""She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went awayyesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Marthaattend to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when tocome here.""Then Mary understood Martha's troubled look when she had askedquestions about the crying.""Martha knew about you all the time?"" she said.""Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me andthen Martha comes.""""I have been here a long time,"" said Mary. ""Shall I go away now? Youreyes look sleepy.""""I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,"" he said rather shyly.""Shut your eyes,"" said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, ""and I willdo what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and stroke itand sing something quite low.""""I should like that perhaps,"" he said drowsily.Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so sheleaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing avery low little chanting song in Hindustani.""That is nice,"" he said more drowsily still, and she went on chantingand stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes werelying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fastasleep. So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away withoutmaking a sound."

There could be no going out of doors. Martha wasso busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in theafternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. Shecame bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doingnothing else.""What's the matter with thee?"" she asked as soon as they sat down. ""Tha'looks as if tha'd somethin' to say.""""I have. I have found out what the crying was,"" said Mary.Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startledeyes.""Tha' hasn't!"" she exclaimed. ""Never!""""I heard it in the night,"" Mary went on. ""And I got up and went to seewhere it came from. It was Colin. I found him.""Martha's face became red with fright.""Eh! Miss Mary!"" she said half crying. ""Tha' shouldn't have doneit—tha' shouldn't! Tha'll get me in trouble. I never told thee nothin'about him—but tha'll get me in trouble. I shall lose my place andwhat'll mother do!""""You won't lose your place,"" said Mary. ""He was glad I came. We talkedand talked and he said he was glad I came.""""Was he?"" cried Martha. ""Art tha' sure? Tha' doesn't know what he's likewhen anything vexes him. He's a big lad to cry like a baby, but whenhe's in a passion he'll fair scream just to frighten us. He knows usdaren't call our souls our own.""""He wasn't vexed,"" said Mary. ""I asked him if I should go away and hemade me stay. He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool andtalked to him about India and about the robin and gardens. He wouldn'tlet me go. He let me see his mother's picture. Before I left him I sanghim to sleep.""Martha fairly gasped with amazement.""I can scarcely believe thee!"" she protested. ""It's as if tha'd walkedstraight into a lion's den. If he'd been like he is most times he'd havethrowed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th' house. He won'tlet strangers look at him.""""He let me look at him. I looked at him all the time and he looked atme. We stared!"" said Mary.""I don't know what to do!"" cried agitated Martha. ""If Mrs. Medlock findsout, she'll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be packedback to mother.""""He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet. It's to bea sort of secret just at first,"" said Mary firmly. ""And he sayseverybody is obliged to do as he pleases.""""Aye, that's true enough—th' bad lad!"" sighed Martha, wiping herforehead with her apron.""He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to come and talk to himevery day. And you are to tell me when he wants me.""""Me!"" said Martha; "" I shall lose my place—I shall for sure!""""You can't if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody isordered to obey him,"" Mary argued.""Does tha' mean to say,"" cried Martha with wide open eyes, ""that he wasnice to thee!""""I think he almost liked me,"" Mary answered.""Then tha' must have bewitched him!"" decided Martha, drawing a longbreath.""Do you mean Magic?"" inquired Mary. ""I've heard about Magic in India,but I can't make it. I just went into his room and I was so surprisedto see him I stood and stared. And then he turned round and stared atme. And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps hewas. And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of thenight and not knowing about each other. And we began to ask each otherquestions. And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must not.""""Th' world's comin' to a end!"" gasped Martha.""What is the matter with him?"" asked Mary.""Nobody knows for sure and certain,"" said Martha. ""Mr. Craven went offhis head like when he was born. Th' doctors thought he'd have to be putin a 'sylum. It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you. Hewouldn't set eyes on th' baby. He just raved and said it'd be anotherhunchback like him and it'd better die.""""Is Colin a hunchback?"" Mary asked. ""He didn't look like one.""""He isn't yet,"" said Martha. ""But he began all wrong. Mother said thatthere was enough trouble and raging in th' house to set any child wrong.They was afraid his back was weak an' they've always been takin' care ofit—keepin' him lyin' down and not lettin' him walk. Once they made himwear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill. Then a big doctorcame to see him an' made them take it off. He talked to th' other doctorquite rough—in a polite way. He said there'd been too much medicine andtoo much lettin' him have his own way.""""I think he's a very spoiled boy,"" said Mary.""He's th' worst young nowt as ever was!"" said Martha. ""I won't say as hehasn't been ill a good bit. He's had coughs an' colds that's nearlykilled him two or three times. Once he had rheumatic fever an' once hehad typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then. He'd been out ofhis head an' she was talkin' to th' nurse, thinkin' he didn't knownothin', an' she said, 'He'll die this time sure enough, an' best thingfor him an' for everybody.' An' she looked at him an' there he was withhis big eyes open, starin' at her as sensible as she was herself. Shedidn't know what'd happen but he just stared at her an' says, 'You giveme some water an' stop talkin'.'""""Do you think he will die?"" asked Mary.""Mother says there's no reason why any child should live that gets nofresh air an' doesn't do nothin' but lie on his back an' readpicture-books an' take medicine. He's weak and hates th' trouble o'bein' taken out o' doors, an' he gets cold so easy he says it makes himill.""Mary sat and looked at the fire.""I wonder,"" she said slowly, ""if it would not do him good to go out intoa garden and watch things growing. It did me good.""""One of th' worst fits he ever had,"" said Martha, ""was one time theytook him out where the roses is by the fountain. He'd been readin' in apaper about people gettin' somethin' he called 'rose cold' an' he beganto sneeze an' said he'd got it an' then a new gardener as didn't knowth' rules passed by an' looked at him curious. He threw himself into apassion an' he said he'd looked at him because he was going to be ahunchback. He cried himself into a fever an' was ill all night.""""If he ever gets angry at me, I'll never go and see him again,"" saidMary.""He'll have thee if he wants thee,"" said Martha. ""Tha' may as well knowthat at th' start.""Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting.""I dare say th' nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,"" she said. ""Ihope he's in a good temper.""She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with apuzzled expression.""Well, tha' has bewitched him,"" she said. ""He's up on his sofa with hispicture-books. He's told the nurse to stay away until six o'clock. I'mto wait in the next room. Th' minute she was gone he called me to himan' says, 'I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and rememberyou're not to tell any one.' You'd better go as quick as you can.""Mary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not want to see Colin asmuch as she wanted to see Dickon, but she wanted to see him very much.There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and inthe daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. There wererich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the wallswhich made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray skyand falling rain. Colin looked rather like a picture himself. He waswrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocadedcushion. He had a red spot on each cheek.""Come in,"" he said. ""I've been thinking about you all morning.""""I've been thinking about you, too,"" answered Mary. ""You don't know howfrightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me aboutyou and then she will be sent away.""He frowned.""Go and tell her to come here,"" he said. ""She is in the next room.""Mary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes.Colin was still frowning.""Have you to do what I please or have you not?"" he demanded.""I have to do what you please, sir,"" Martha faltered, turning quite red.""Has Medlock to do what I please?""""Everybody has, sir,"" said Martha.""Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlocksend you away if she finds it out?""""Please don't let her, sir,"" pleaded Martha.""I'll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing,""said Master Craven grandly. ""She wouldn't like that, I can tell you.""""Thank you, sir,"" bobbing a curtsy, ""I want to do my duty, sir.""""What I want is your duty,"" said Colin more grandly still. ""I'll takecare of you. Now go away.""When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing athim as if he had set her wondering.""Why do you look at me like that?"" he asked her. ""What are you thinkingabout?""""I am thinking about two things.""""What are they? Sit down and tell me.""""This is the first one,"" said Mary, seating herself on the big stool.""Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeraldsand diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as youspoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them—in aminute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn't.""""I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,"" he said, ""but firsttell me what the second thing was.""""I was thinking,"" said Mary, ""how different you are from Dickon.""""Who is Dickon?"" he said. ""What a queer name!""She might as well tell him, she thought. She could talk about Dickonwithout mentioning the secret garden. She had liked to hear Martha talkabout him. Besides, she longed to talk about him. It would seem to bringhim nearer.""He is Martha's brother. He is twelve years old,"" she explained. ""He isnot like any one else in the world. He can charm foxes and squirrels andbirds just as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a very softtune on a pipe and they come and listen.""There were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged onesuddenly toward him.""There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,"" he exclaimed. ""Come andlook at it.""The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and heturned to one of them.""Can he do that?"" he asked eagerly.""He played on his pipe and they listened,"" Mary explained. ""But hedoesn't call it Magic. He says it's because he lives on the moor so muchand he knows their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if he was a birdor a rabbit himself, he likes them so. I think he asked the robinquestions. It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.""Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger andthe spots on his cheeks burned.""Tell me some more about him,"" he said.""He knows all about eggs and nests,"" Mary went on. "" And he knows wherefoxes and badgers and otters live. He keeps them secret so that otherboys won't find their holes and frighten them. He knows about everythingthat grows or lives on the moor.""""Does he like the moor?"" said Colin. ""How can he when it's such a great,bare, dreary place?""""It's the most beautiful place,"" protested Mary. ""Thousands of lovelythings grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busybuilding nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singingor squeaking to each other. They are so busy and having such fun underthe earth or in the trees or heather. It's their world.""""How do you know all that?"" said Colin, turning on his elbow to look ather.""I have never been there once, really,"" said Mary suddenly remembering.""I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous. Martha toldme about it first and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you feelas if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in theheather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey—and allfull of bees and butterflies.""""You never see anything if you are ill,"" said Colin restlessly. Helooked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance andwondering what it was.""You can't if you stay in a room,"" said Mary.""I couldn't go on the moor,"" he said in a resentful tone.Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.""You might—sometime.""He moved as if he were startled.""Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.""""How do you know?"" said Mary unsympathetically. She didn't like the wayhe had of talking about dying. She did not feel very sympathetic. Shefelt rather as if he almost boasted about it.""Oh, I've heard it ever since I remember,"" he answered crossly. ""Theyare always whispering about it and thinking I don't notice. They wish Iwould, too.""Mistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.""If they wished I would,"" she said, ""I wouldn't. Who wishes you would?""""The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would getMisselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren't say so, but healways looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his facegot quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too.""""I don't believe he does,"" said Mary quite obstinately.That made Colin turn and look at her again.""Don't you?"" he said.And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he werethinking. And there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both ofthem thinking strange things children do not usually think of.""I like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the ironthing off,"" said Mary at last. ""Did he say you were going to die?""""No.""""What did he say?""""He didn't whisper,"" Colin answered. ""Perhaps he knew I hatedwhispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He said, 'The ladmight live if he would make up his mind to it. Put him in the humor.' Itsounded as if he was in a temper.""""I'll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,"" said Maryreflecting. She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled oneway or the other. ""I believe Dickon would. He's always talking aboutlive things. He never talks about dead things or things that are ill.He's always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying—or looking downat the earth to see something growing. He has such round blue eyes andthey are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs such a big laughwith his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as cherries.""She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changedat the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes.""See here,"" she said. ""Don't let us talk about dying; I don't like it.Let us talk about living. Let us talk and talk about Dickon. And then wewill look at your pictures.""It was the best thing she could have said. To talk about Dickon meant totalk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people wholived in it on sixteen shillings a week—and the children who got fat onthe moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon's mother—and theskipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about pale greenpoints sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so alive thatMary talked more than she had ever talked before—and Colin both talkedand listened as he had never done either before. And they both began tolaugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together. Andthey laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as ifthey had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-oldcreatures—instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy whobelieved that he was going to die.They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and theyforgot about the time. They had been laughing quite loudly over BenWeatherstaff and his robin and Colin was actually sitting up as if hehad forgotten about his weak back when he suddenly rememberedsomething.""Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,"" he said.""We are cousins.""It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never rememberedthis simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had gotinto the humor to laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun thedoor opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell backbecause he had accidentally bumped against her.""Good Lord!"" exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock, with her eyes almost startingout of her head. ""Good Lord!""""What is this?"" said Dr. Craven, coming forward. ""What does it mean?""Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as ifneither the doctor's alarm nor Mrs. Medlock's terror were of theslightest consequence. He was as little disturbed or frightened as if anelderly cat and dog had walked into the room.""This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,"" he said. ""I asked her to come and talkto me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send forher.""Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.""Oh, sir,"" she panted. ""I don't know how it's happened. There's not aservant on the place that'd dare to talk—they all have their orders.""""Nobody told her anything,"" said Colin, ""she heard me crying and foundme herself. I am glad she came. Don't be silly, Medlock.""Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plainthat he dare not oppose his patient. He sat down by Colin and felt hispulse.""I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not goodfor you, my boy,"" he said.""I should be excited if she kept away,"" answered Colin, his eyesbeginning to look dangerously sparkling. ""I am better. She makes mebetter. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We will have teatogether.""Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, butthere was evidently nothing to be done.""He does look rather better, sir,"" ventured Mrs. Medlock.""But""—thinking the matter over—""he looked better this morning beforeshe came into the room.""""She came into the room last night. She stayed with me a long time. Shesang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,"" said Colin. ""Iwas better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea now.Tell nurse, Medlock.""Dr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to the nurse for a fewminutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning toColin. He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill; hemust not forget that he was very easily tired. Mary thought that thereseemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget.Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr.Craven's face.""I want to forget it,"" he said at last. ""She makes me forget it. Thatis why I want her.""Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzledglance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. She had become astiff, silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not seewhat the attraction was. The boy actually did look brighter,however—and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor.""They are always wanting me to eat things when I don't want to,"" saidColin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by thesofa. ""Now, if you'll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice and hot.Tell me about Rajahs."""

Though there had been no chanceto see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyedherself very much. The week had not seemed long. She had spent hours ofevery day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or gardens orDickon and the cottage on the moor. They had looked at the splendidbooks and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, andsometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused and interestedshe thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that hisface was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.""You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to gofollowing things up like you did that night,"" Mrs. Medlock said once.""But there's no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to the lot ofus. He's not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. Thenurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick ofhim, but she says she doesn't mind staying now you've gone on duty withher,"" laughing a little.In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about thesecret garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out fromhim, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him directquestions. In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, shewanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell asecret to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently sopleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that shethought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him longenough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was this: Ifhe could be trusted—if he really could—wouldn't it be possible to takehim to the garden without having any one find it out? The grand doctorhad said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he wouldnot mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal offresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he mightnot think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glasssometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a differentcreature from the child she had seen when she arrived from India. Thischild looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her.""Th' air from th' moor has done thee good already,"" she had said.""Tha'rt not nigh so yeller and tha'rt not nigh so scrawny. Even tha'hair doesn't slamp down on tha' head so flat. It's got some life in itso as it sticks out a bit.""""It's like me,"" said Mary. ""It's growing stronger and fatter. I'm surethere's more of it.""""It looks it, for sure,"" said Martha, ruffling it up a little round herface. ""Tha'rt not half so ugly when it's that way an' there's a bit o'red in tha' cheeks.""If gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would begood for Colin. But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps hewould not like to see Dickon.""Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?"" she inquired oneday.""I always hated it,"" he answered, ""even when I was very little. Thenwhen they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriageeverybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse andthen they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying Ishouldn't live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat mycheeks and say 'Poor child!' Once when a lady did that I screamed outloud and bit her hand. She was so frightened she ran away.""""She thought you had gone mad like a dog,"" said Mary, not at alladmiringly.""I don't care what she thought,"" said Colin, frowning.""I wonder why you didn't scream and bite me when I came into your room?""said Mary. Then she began to smile slowly.""I thought you were a ghost or a dream,"" he said. ""You can't bite aghost or a dream, and if you scream they don't care.""""Would you hate it if—if a boy looked at you?"" Mary asked uncertainly.He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.""There's one boy,"" he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking overevery word, ""there's one boy I believe I shouldn't mind. It's that boywho knows where the foxes live—Dickon.""""I'm sure you wouldn't mind him,"" said Mary.""The birds don't and other animals,"" he said, still thinking it over,""perhaps that's why I shouldn't. He's a sort of animal charmer and I ama boy animal.""Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their bothlaughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding inhis hole very funny indeed.What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon.On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened veryearly. The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and therewas something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bedand ran to the window. She drew up the blinds and opened the windowitself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The moorwas blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happenedto it. There were tender little fluting sounds here and there andeverywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for aconcert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.""It's warm—warm!"" she said. ""It will make the green points push up andup and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle withall their might under the earth.""She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could,breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because sheremembered what Dickon's mother had said about the end of his nosequivering like a rabbit's.""It must be very early,"" she said. ""The little clouds are all pink andI've never seen the sky look like this. No one is up. I don't even hearthe stable boys.""A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.""I can't wait! I am going to see the garden!""She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothesin five minutes. She knew a small side door which she could unboltherself and she flew down-stairs in her stocking feet and put on hershoes in the hall. She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when thedoor was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there shewas standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and withthe sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and thefluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. Sheclasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was soblue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime lightthat she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew thatthrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ranaround the shrubs and paths toward the secret garden.""It is all different already,"" she said. ""The grass is greener andthings are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and greenbuds of leaves are showing. This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.""The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds whichbordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting andpushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actuallyhere and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among thestems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seenhow the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy,she was startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw—caw of a crowand it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sata big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wiselyindeed. She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her alittle nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped awayacross the garden. She hoped he was not going to stay inside and shepushed the door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly into thegarden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he hadalighted on a dwarf apple-tree, and under the apple-tree was lying alittle reddish animal with a bushy tail, and both of them were watchingthe stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on thegrass working hard.Mary flew across the grass to him.""Oh, Dickon! Dickon!"" she cried out. ""How could you get here so early!How could you! The sun has only just got up!""He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like abit of the sky.""Eh!"" he said. ""I was up long before him. How could I have stayed abed!Th' world's all fair begun again this mornin', it has. An' it's workin'an' hummin' an' scratchin' an' pipin' an' nest-buildin' an' breathin'out scents, till you've got to be out on it 'stead o' lyin' on yourback. When th' sun did jump up, th' moor went mad for joy, an' I was inthe midst of th' heather, an' I run like mad myself, shoutin' an'singin'. An' I come straight here. I couldn't have stayed away. Why, th'garden was lyin' here waitin'!""Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been runningherself.""Oh, Dickon! Dickon!"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can scarcely breathe!""Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rosefrom its place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawingonce, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.""This is th' little fox cub,"" he said, rubbing the little reddishanimal's head. ""It's named Captain. An' this here's Soot. Soot he flewacross th' moor with me an' Captain he run same as if th' hounds hadbeen after him. They both felt same as I did.""Neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of Mary.When Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his shoulder and Captaintrotted quietly close to his side.""See here!"" said Dickon. ""See how these has pushed up, an' these an'these! An' Eh! look at these here!""He threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down beside him. They hadcome upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange andgold. Mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them.""You never kiss a person in that way,"" she said when she lifted herhead. ""Flowers are so different.""He looked puzzled but smiled.""Eh!"" he said, ""I've kissed mother many a time that way when I come infrom th' moor after a day's roamin' an' she stood there at th' door inth' sun, lookin' so glad an' comfortable.""They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so manywonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they mustwhisper or speak low. He showed her swelling leaf-buds on rose brancheswhich had seemed dead. He showed her ten thousand new green pointspushing through the mould. They put their eager young noses close to theearth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulledand laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary's hair was as tumbledas Dickon's and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and inthe midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because itwas more wonderful. Swiftly something flew across the wall and dartedthrough the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare ofred-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak. Dickon stoodquite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenlyfound themselves laughing in a church.""We munnot stir,"" he whispered in broad Yorkshire. ""We munnot scarcebreathe. I knowed he was mate-huntin' when I seed him last. It's BenWeatherstaff's robin. He's buildin' his nest. He'll stay here if usdon't flight him.""They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.""Us mustn't seem as if us was watchin' him too close,"" said Dickon.""He'd be out with us for good if he got th' notion us was interferin'now. He'll be a good bit different till all this is over. He's settin'up housekeepin'. He'll be shyer an' readier to take things ill. He's gotno time for visitin' an' gossipin'. Us must keep still a bit an' try tolook as if us was grass an' trees an' bushes. Then when he's got used toseein' us I'll chirp a bit an' he'll know us'll not be in his way.""Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to,how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes. But he had said thequeer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in theworld, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watchedhim for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him toquietly turn green and put out branches and leaves. But he only satwonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such asoftness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could.""It's part o' th' springtime, this nest-buildin' is,"" he said. ""Iwarrant it's been goin' on in th' same way every year since th' worldwas begun. They've got their way o' thinkin' and doin' things an' abody had better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime easierthan any other season if you're too curious.""""If we talk about him I can't help looking at him,"" Mary said as softlyas possible. ""We must talk of something else. There is something I wantto tell you.""""He'll like it better if us talks o' somethin' else,"" said Dickon. ""Whatis it tha's got to tell me?""""Well—do you know about Colin?"" she whispered.He turned his head to look at her.""What does tha' know about him?"" he asked.""I've seen him. I have been to talk to him every day this week. He wantsme to come. He says I'm making him forget about being ill and dying,""answered Mary.Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away fromhis round face.""I am glad o' that,"" he exclaimed. ""I'm right down glad. It makes meeasier. I knowed I must say nothin' about him an' I don't like havin' tohide things.""""Don't you like hiding the garden?"" said Mary.""I'll never tell about it,"" he answered. ""But I says to mother,'Mother,' I says, 'I got a secret to keep. It's not a bad 'un, tha'knows that. It's no worse than hidin' where a bird's nest is. Tha'doesn't mind it, does tha'?'""Mary always wanted to hear about mother.""What did she say?"" she asked, not at all afraid to hear.Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly.""It was just like her, what she said,"" he answered. ""She give my head abit of a rub an' laughed an' she says, 'Eh, lad, tha' can have all th'secrets tha' likes. I've knowed thee twelve year'.'""""How did you know about Colin?"" asked Mary.""Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little ladas was like to be a cripple, an' they knowed Mester Craven didn't likehim to be talked about. Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs.Craven was such a pretty young lady an' they was so fond of each other.Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an' shedoesn't mind talkin' to mother before us children, because she knows ushas been brought up to be trusty. How did tha' find out about him?Martha was in fine trouble th' last time she came home. She said tha'dheard him frettin' an' tha' was askin' questions an' she didn't knowwhat to say.""Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind whichhad wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complainingvoice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and hadended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with thecarven four-posted bed in the corner. When she described the smallivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook hishead.""Them's just like his mother's eyes, only hers was always laughin', theysay,"" he said. ""They say as Mr. Craven can't bear to see him when he'sawake an' it's because his eyes is so like his mother's an' yet looks sodifferent in his miserable bit of a face.""""Do you think he wants him to die?"" whispered Mary.""No, but he wishes he'd never been born. Mother she says that's th'worst thing on earth for a child. Them as is not wanted scarce everthrives. Mester Craven he'd buy anythin' as money could buy for th' poorlad but he'd like to forget as he's on earth. For one thing, he's afraidhe'll look at him some day and find he's growed hunchback.""""Colin's so afraid of it himself that he won't sit up,"" said Mary. ""Hesays he's always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming heshould go crazy and scream himself to death.""""Eh! he oughtn't to lie there thinkin' things like that,"" said Dickon.""No lad could get well as thought them sort o' things.""The fox was lying on the grass close by him looking up to ask for a patnow and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly andthought a few minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his head andlooked round the garden.""When first we got in here,"" he said, ""it seemed like everything wasgray. Look round now and tell me if tha' doesn't see a difference.""Mary looked and caught her breath a little.""Why!"" she cried, ""the gray wall is changing. It is as if a green mistwere creeping over it. It's almost like a green gauze veil.""""Aye,"" said Dickon. ""An' it'll be greener and greener till th' gray'sall gone. Can tha' guess what I was thinkin'?""""I know it was something nice,"" said Mary eagerly. ""I believe it wassomething about Colin.""""I was thinkin' that if he was out here he wouldn't be watchin' forlumps to grow on his back; he'd be watchin' for buds to break on th'rose-bushes, an' he'd likely be healthier,"" explained Dickon. ""I waswonderin' if us could ever get him in th' humor to come out here an'lie under th' trees in his carriage.""""I've been wondering that myself. I've thought of it almost every timeI've talked to him,"" said Mary. ""I've wondered if he could keep a secretand I've wondered if we could bring him here without any one seeing us.I thought perhaps you could push his carriage. The doctor said he musthave fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobeyhim. He won't go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad ifhe will go out with us. He could order the gardeners to keep away sothey wouldn't find out.""Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain's back.""It'd be good for him, I'll warrant,"" he said. ""Us'd not be thinkin'he'd better never been born. Us'd be just two children watchin' a gardengrow, an' he'd be another. Two lads an' a little lass just lookin' on atth' springtime. I warrant it'd be better than doctor's stuff.""""He's been lying in his room so long and he's always been so afraid ofhis back that it has made him queer,"" said Mary. ""He knows a good manythings out of books but he doesn't know anything else. He says he hasbeen too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hatesgardens and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden becauseit is a secret. I daren't tell him much but he said he wanted to seeit.""""Us'll have him out here sometime for sure,"" said Dickon. ""I could pushhis carriage well enough. Has tha' noticed how th' robin an' his matehas been workin' while we've been sittin' here? Look at him perched onthat branch wonderin' where it'd be best to put that twig he's got inhis beak.""He made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head andlooked at him inquiringly, still holding his twig. Dickon spoke to himas Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon's tone was one of friendly advice.""Wheres'ever tha' puts it,"" he said, ""it'll be all right. Tha' knew howto build tha' nest before tha' came out o' th' egg. Get on with thee,lad. Tha'st got no time to lose.""""Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!"" Mary said, laughingdelightedly. ""Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and hehops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he likesit. Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stonesthrown at him than not be noticed.""Dickon laughed too and went on talking.""Tha' knows us won't trouble thee,"" he said to the robin. ""Us is nearbein' wild things ourselves. Us is nest-buildin' too, bless thee. Lookout tha' doesn't tell on us.""And though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied, Maryknew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of thegarden the darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not telltheir secret for the world."

SAID MARY","They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late inreturning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to herwork that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment.""Tell Colin that I can't come and see him yet,"" she said to Martha. ""I'mvery busy in the garden.""Martha looked rather frightened.""Eh! Miss Mary,"" she said, ""it may put him all out of humor when I tellhim that.""But Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not aself-sacrificing person.""I can't stay,"" she answered. ""Dickon's waiting for me;"" and she ranaway.The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most ofthe roses and trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought aspade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so thatby this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was notlikely to become a ""gardener's garden"" it would be a wilderness ofgrowing things before the springtime was over.""There'll be apple blossoms an' cherry blossoms overhead,"" Dickon said,working away with all his might. ""An' there'll be peach an' plum treesin bloom against th' walls, an' th' grass'll be a carpet o' flowers.""The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and therobin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks oflightning. Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared awayover the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back and perched nearDickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures,and Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin. Once whenDickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on tohis shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Marywanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and oncehe took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange littlenotes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.""Tha's a good bit stronger than tha' was,"" Dickon said, looking at heras she was digging. ""Tha's beginning to look different, for sure.""Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.""I'm getting fatter and fatter every day,"" she said quite exultantly.""Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha says myhair is growing thicker. It isn't so flat and stringy.""The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slantingunder the trees when they parted.""It'll be fine to-morrow,"" said Dickon. ""I'll be at work by sunrise.""""So will I,"" said Mary.She ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. Shewanted to tell Colin about Dickon's fox cub and the rook and about whatthe springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like to hear. Soit was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to seeMartha standing waiting for her with a doleful face.""What is the matter?"" she asked. ""What did Colin say when you told him Icouldn't come?""""Eh!"" said Martha, ""I wish tha'd gone. He was nigh goin' into one o'his tantrums. There's been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet.He would watch the clock all th' time.""Mary's lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used toconsidering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why anill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best. Sheknew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill andnervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers andneed not make other people ill and nervous, too. When she had had aheadache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else alsohad a headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she was quiteright; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong.He was not on his sofa when she went into his room. He was lying flat onhis back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in.This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiffmanner.""Why didn't you get up?"" she said.""I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,"" he answered,without looking at her. ""I made them put me back in bed this afternoon.My back ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why didn't you come?""""I was working in the garden with Dickon,"" said Mary.Colin frowned and condescended to look at her.""I won't let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead ofcoming to talk to me,"" he said.Mary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into a passion withoutmaking a noise. She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care whathappened.""If you send Dickon away, I'll never come into this room again!"" sheretorted.""You'll have to if I want you,"" said Colin.""I won't!"" said Mary.""I'll make you,"" said Colin, ""They shall drag you in.""""Shall they, Mr. Rajah!"" said Mary fiercely. ""They may drag me in butthey can't make me talk when they get me here. I'll sit and clench myteeth and never tell you one thing. I won't even look at you. I'll stareat the floor!""They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If theyhad been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other andhad a rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing to it.""You are a selfish thing!"" cried Colin.""What are you?"" said Mary. ""Selfish people always say that. Any one isselfish who doesn't do what they want. You're more selfish than I am.You're the most selfish boy I ever saw.""""I'm not!"" snapped Colin. ""I'm not as selfish as your fine Dickon is! Hekeeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself. He'sselfish, if you like!""Mary's eyes flashed fire.""He's nicer than any other boy that ever lived!"" she said. ""He's—he'slike an angel!"" It might sound rather silly to say that but she did notcare.""A nice angel!"" Colin sneered ferociously. ""He's a common cottage boyoff the moor!""""He's better than a common Rajah!"" retorted Mary. ""He's a thousand timesbetter!""Because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get thebetter of him. The truth was that he had never had a fight with any onelike himself in his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good forhim, though neither he nor Mary knew anything about that. He turned hishead on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out andran down his cheek. He was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry forhimself—not for any one else.""I'm not as selfish as you, because I'm always ill, and I'm sure thereis a lump coming on my back,"" he said. ""And I am going to die besides.""""You're not!"" contradicted Mary unsympathetically.He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had never heard sucha thing said before. He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if aperson could be both at the same time.""I'm not?"" he cried. ""I am! You know I am! Everybody says so.""""I don't believe it!"" said Mary sourly. ""You just say that to makepeople sorry. I believe you're proud of it. I don't believe it! If youwere a nice boy it might be true—but you're too nasty!""In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthyrage.""Get out of the room!"" he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow andthrew it at her. He was not strong enough to throw it far and it onlyfell at her feet, but Mary's face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.""I'm going,"" she said. ""And I won't come back!""She walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round andspoke again.""I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,"" she said. ""Dickonbrought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all aboutthem. Now I won't tell you a single thing!""She marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to hergreat astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she hadbeen listening and, more amazing still—she was laughing. She was a bighandsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all,as she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses toleave Colin to Martha or any one else who would take her place. Mary hadnever liked her, and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stoodgiggling into her handkerchief.""What are you laughing at?"" she asked her.""At you two young ones,"" said the nurse. ""It's the best thing that couldhappen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to himthat's as spoiled as himself;"" and she laughed into her handkerchiefagain. ""If he'd had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it wouldhave been the saving of him.""""Is he going to die?""""I don't know and I don't care,"" said the nurse. ""Hysterics and temperare half what ails him.""""What are hysterics?"" asked Mary.""You'll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this—but at anyrate you've given him something to have hysterics about, and I'm gladof it.""Mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when shehad come in from the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not atall sorry for Colin. She had looked forward to telling him a great manythings and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would besafe to trust him with the great secret. She had been beginning to thinkit would be, but now she had changed her mind entirely. She would nevertell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air anddie if he liked! It would serve him right! She felt so sour andunrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon andthe green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing downfrom the moor.Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had beentemporarily replaced by interest and curiosity. There was a wooden boxon the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it wasfull of neat packages.""Mr. Craven sent it to you,"" said Martha. ""It looks as if it hadpicture-books in it.""Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room.""Do you want anything—dolls—toys—books?"" She opened the packagewondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should dowith it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several beautifulbooks such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and werefull of pictures. There were two or three games and there was abeautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold penand inkstand.Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out ofher mind. She had not expected him to remember her at all and her hardlittle heart grew quite warm.""I can write better than I can print,"" she said, ""and the first thing Ishall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am muchobliged.""If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him herpresents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and readsome of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and hewould have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought hewas going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was alump coming. He had a way of doing that which she could not bear. Itgave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked sofrightened himself. He said that if he felt even quite a little lumpsome day he should know his hunch had begun to grow. Something he hadheard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and hehad thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in hismind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father's back had begun to show itscrookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told any onebut Mary that most of his ""tantrums"" as they called them grew out of hishysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had toldher.""He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,"" she saidto herself. ""And he has been cross to-day. Perhaps—perhaps he has beenthinking about it all afternoon.""She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.""I said I would never go back again—"" she hesitated, knitting herbrows—""but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see—if he wants me—inthe morning. Perhaps he'll try to throw his pillow at me again, but—Ithink—I'll go."""

As she laidher head on the pillow she murmured to herself:""I'll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward—Ibelieve—I'll go to see him.""She thought it was the middle of the night when she was wakened by suchdreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant. What wasit—what was it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew. Doorswere opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors andsome one was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and cryingin a horrible way.""It's Colin,"" she said. ""He's having one of those tantrums the nursecalled hysterics. How awful it sounds.""As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that peoplewere so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything ratherthan hear them. She put her hands over her ears and felt sick andshivering.""I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do,"" she kept saying. ""Ican't bear it.""Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then sheremembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought thatperhaps the sight of her might make him worse. Even when she pressed herhands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful soundsout. She hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly theybegan to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into atantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her. She was notused to any one's tempers but her own. She took her hands from her earsand sprang up and stamped her foot.""He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop! Somebody oughtto beat him!"" she cried out.Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her dooropened and the nurse came in. She was not laughing now by any means. Sheeven looked rather pale.""He's worked himself into hysterics,"" she said in a great hurry. ""He'lldo himself harm. No one can do anything with him. You come and try,like a good child. He likes you.""""He turned me out of the room this morning,"" said Mary, stamping herfoot with excitement.The stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that she had beenafraid she might find Mary crying and hiding her head under thebed-clothes.""That's right,"" she said. ""You're in the right humor. You go and scoldhim. Give him something new to think of. Do go, child, as quick as everyou can.""It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had beenfunny as well as dreadful—that it was funny that all the grown-uppeople were so frightened that they came to a little girl just becausethey guessed she was almost as bad as Colin himself.She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams thehigher her temper mounted. She felt quite wicked by the time she reachedthe door. She slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room tothe four-posted bed.""You stop!"" she almost shouted. ""You stop! I hate you! Everybody hatesyou! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you screamyourself to death! You will scream yourself to death in a minute, andI wish you would!""A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said suchthings, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the bestpossible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared torestrain or contradict.He had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and heactually almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of thefurious little voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red andswollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did notcare an atom.""If you scream another scream,"" she said, ""I'll scream too—and I canscream louder than you can and I'll frighten you, I'll frighten you!""He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. Thescream which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were streamingdown his face and he shook all over.""I can't stop!"" he gasped and sobbed. ""I can't—I can't!""""You can!"" shouted Mary. ""Half that ails you is hysterics andtemper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics!"" and she stamped each timeshe said it.""I felt the lump—I felt it,"" choked out Colin. ""I knew I should. Ishall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,"" and he began towrithe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn'tscream.""You didn't feel a lump!"" contradicted Mary fiercely. ""If you did it wasonly a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps. There's nothing thematter with your horrid back—nothing but hysterics! Turn over and letme look at it!""She liked the word ""hysterics"" and felt somehow as if it had an effecton him. He was probably like herself and had never heard it before.""Nurse,"" she commanded, ""come here and show me his back this minute!""The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled togethernear the door staring at her, their mouths half open. All three hadgasped with fright more than once. The nurse came forward as if she werehalf afraid. Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.""Perhaps he—he won't let me,"" she hesitated in a low voice.Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:""Sh—show her! She—she'll see then!""It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared. Every rib could becounted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not countthem as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage littleface. She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned herhead aside to hide the twitching of her mouth. There was just a minute'ssilence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary looked upand down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she had been thegreat doctor from London.""There's not a single lump there!"" she said at last. ""There's not a lumpas big as a pin—except backbone lumps, and you can only feel thembecause you're thin. I've got backbone lumps myself, and they used tostick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am notfat enough yet to hide them. There's not a lump as big as a pin! If youever say there is again, I shall laugh!""No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childishwords had on him. If he had ever had any one to talk to about his secretterrors—if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions—if he hadhad childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closedhouse, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who weremost of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out thatmost of his fright and illness was created by himself. But he had lainand thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and daysand months and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girlinsisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was heactually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.""I didn't know,"" ventured the nurse, ""that he thought he had a lump onhis spine. His back is weak because he won't try to sit up. I could havetold him there was no lump there.""Colin gulped and turned his face a little to look at her.""C-could you?"" he said pathetically.""Yes, sir.""""There!"" said Mary, and she gulped too.Colin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn brokenbreaths, which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay stillfor a minute, though great tears streamed down his face and wet thepillow. Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come tohim. Presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangelyenough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke to her.""Do you think—I could—live to grow up?"" he said.The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat someof the London doctor's words.""You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not giveway to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.""Colin's tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying andthis perhaps made him feel gentle. He put out his hand a little towardMary, and I am glad to say that, her own tantrum having passed, she wassoftened too and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sortof making up.""I'll—I'll go out with you, Mary,"" he said. ""I shan't hate fresh air ifwe can find—"" He remembered just in time to stop himself from saying""if we can find the secret garden"" and he ended, ""I shall like to go outwith you if Dickon will come and push my chair. I do so want to seeDickon and the fox and the crow.""The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows.Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who reallywas very glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock and Marthagladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm and in orderthe nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also. She was ahealthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep and sheyawned quite openly as she looked at Mary, who had pushed her bigfootstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin's hand.""You must go back and get your sleep out,"" she said. ""He'll drop offafter a while—if he's not too upset. Then I'll lie down myself in thenext room.""""Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?"" Marywhispered to Colin.His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on herappealingly.""Oh, yes!"" he answered. ""It's such a soft song. I shall go to sleep in aminute.""""I will put him to sleep,"" Mary said to the yawning nurse. ""You can goif you like.""""Well,"" said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. ""If he doesn't goto sleep in half an hour you must call me.""""Very well,"" answered Mary.The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was goneColin pulled Mary's hand again.""I almost told,"" he said; ""but I stopped myself in time. I won't talkand I'll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things totell me. Have you—do you think you have found out anything at all aboutthe way into the secret garden?""Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her heartrelented.""Ye-es,"" she answered, ""I think I have. And if you will go to sleep Iwill tell you to-morrow.""His hand quite trembled.""Oh, Mary!"" he said. ""Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I shouldlive to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayahsong—you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what youimagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.""""Yes,"" answered Mary. ""Shut your eyes.""He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and beganto speak very slowly and in a very low voice.""I think it has been left alone so long—that it has grown all into alovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbeduntil they hang from the branches and walls and creep over theground—almost like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died butmany—are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains andfountains of roses. I think the ground is full of daffodils andsnowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark. Now thespring has begun—perhaps—perhaps—""The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and shesaw it and went on.""Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there areclusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now. Perhaps the leavesare beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is changingand a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping over—everything. Andthe birds are coming to look at it—because it is—so safe and still.And perhaps—perhaps—perhaps—"" very softly and slowly indeed, ""therobin has found a mate—and is building a nest.""And Colin was asleep."

She slept latebecause she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she toldher that though Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as healways was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying. Mary ateher breakfast slowly as she listened.""He says he wishes tha' would please go and see him as soon as tha'can,"" Martha said. ""It's queer what a fancy he's took to thee. Tha' didgive it him last night for sure—didn't tha'? Nobody else would havedared to do it. Eh! poor lad! He's been spoiled till salt won't savehim. Mother says as th' two worst things as can happen to a child isnever to have his own way—or always to have it. She doesn't know whichis th' worst. Tha' was in a fine temper tha'self, too. But he says to mewhen I went into his room, 'Please ask Miss Mary if she'll please comean' talk to me?' Think o' him saying please! Will you go, Miss?""""I'll run and see Dickon first,"" said Mary. ""No, I'll go and see Colinfirst and tell him—I know what I'll tell him,"" with a suddeninspiration.She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin's room and for a second helooked disappointed. He was in bed and his face was pitifully white andthere were dark circles round his eyes.""I'm glad you came,"" he said. ""My head aches and I ache all over becauseI'm so tired. Are you going somewhere?""Mary went and leaned against his bed.""I won't be long,"" she said. ""I'm going to Dickon, but I'll come back.Colin, it's—it's something about the secret garden.""His whole face brightened and a little color came into it.""Oh! is it!"" he cried out. ""I dreamed about it all night. I heard yousay something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I wasstanding in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—andthere were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.I'll lie and think about it until you come back.""In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden. The fox and thecrow were with him again and this time he had brought two tamesquirrels.""I came over on the pony this mornin',"" he said. ""Eh! he is a goodlittle chap—Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here onehe's called Nut an' this here other one's called Shell.""When he said ""Nut"" one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and whenhe said ""Shell"" the other one leaped on to his left shoulder.When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Sootsolemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close tothem, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave suchdelightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the look inDickon's funny face gradually changed her mind. She could see he feltsorrier for Colin than she did. He looked up at the sky and all abouthim.""Just listen to them birds—th' world seems full of 'em—all whistlin'an' pipin',"" he said. ""Look at 'em dartin' about, an' hearken at 'emcallin' to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th' world'scallin'. The leaves is uncurlin' so you can see 'em—an', my word, th'nice smells there is about!"" sniffing with his happy turned-up nose.""An' that poor lad lyin' shut up an' seein' so little that he gets tothinkin' o' things as sets him screamin'. Eh! my! we mun get him outhere—we mun get him watchin' an' listenin' an' sniffin' up th' air an'get him just soaked through wi' sunshine. An' we munnot lose no timeabout it.""When he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshirethough at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary couldbetter understand. But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in factbeen trying to learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a little now.""Aye, that we mun,"" she said (which meant ""Yes, indeed, we must""). ""I'lltell thee what us'll do first,"" she proceeded, and Dickon grinned,because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speakingYorkshire it amused him very much. ""He's took a graidely fancy to thee.He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an' Captain. When I goback to the house to talk to him I'll ax him if tha' canna' come an' seehim to-morrow mornin'—an' bring tha' creatures wi' thee—an' then—in abit, when there's more leaves out, an' happen a bud or two, we'll gethim to come out an' tha' shall push him in his chair an' we'll bring himhere an' show him everything.""When she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She had never made along speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well.""Tha' mun talk a bit o' Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,"" Dickonchuckled. ""Tha'll make him laugh an' there's nowt as good for ill folkas laughin' is. Mother says she believes as half a hour's good laughevery mornin' 'ud cure a chap as was makin' ready for typhus fever.""""I'm going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,"" said Mary, chucklingherself.The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemedas if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of theearth and the boughs with wands. It was hard to go away and leave itall, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress and Shellhad scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayedthere looking at her with inquiring eyes. But she went back to the houseand when she sat down close to Colin's bed he began to sniff as Dickondid though not in such an experienced way.""You smell like flowers and—and fresh things,"" he cried out quitejoyously. ""What is it you smell of? It's cool and warm and sweet all atthe same time.""""It's th' wind from th' moor,"" said Mary. ""It comes o' sittin' on th'grass under a tree wi' Dickon an' wi' Captain an' Soot an' Nut an'Shell. It's th' springtime an' out o' doors an' sunshine as smells sograidely.""She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadlyYorkshire sounds until you have heard some one speak it. Colin began tolaugh.""What are you doing?"" he said. ""I never heard you talk like that before.How funny it sounds.""""I'm givin' thee a bit o' Yorkshire,"" answered Mary triumphantly. ""Icanna' talk as graidely as Dickon an' Martha can but tha' sees I canshape a bit. Doesn't tha' understand a bit o' Yorkshire when tha' hearsit? An' tha' a Yorkshire lad thysel' bred an' born! Eh! I wonder tha'rtnot ashamed o' thy face.""And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they couldnot stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs.Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor andstood listening amazed.""Well, upon my word!"" she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herselfbecause there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished. ""Whoeverheard th' like! Whoever on earth would ha' thought it!""There was so much to talk about. It seemed as if Colin could never hearenough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the ponywhose name was Jump. Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to seeJump. He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hangingover his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose. He wasrather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as ifthe muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs. He hadlifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw Dickon and he hadtrotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder and then Dickonhad talked into his ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinniesand puffs and snorts. Dickon had made him give Mary his small front hoofand kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle.""Does he really understand everything Dickon says?"" Colin asked.""It seems as if he does,"" answered Mary. ""Dickon says anything willunderstand if you're friends with it for sure, but you have to befriends for sure.""Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to bestaring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking.""I wish I was friends with things,"" he said at last, ""but I'm not. Inever had anything to be friends with, and I can't bear people.""""Can't you bear me?"" asked Mary.""Yes, I can,"" he answered. ""It's very funny but I even like you.""""Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,"" said Mary. ""He said he'd warrantwe'd both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are like him too. Weare all three alike—you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He said we wereneither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked. But Idon't feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon.""""Did you feel as if you hated people?""""Yes,"" answered Mary without any affectation. ""I should have detestedyou if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.""Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.""Mary,"" he said, ""I wish I hadn't said what I did about sending Dickonaway. I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed atyou but—but perhaps he is.""""Well, it was rather funny to say it,"" she admitted frankly, ""becausehis nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes havepatches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an angeldid come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshireangel—I believe he'd understand the green things and know how to makethem grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickondoes and they'd know he was friends for sure.""""I shouldn't mind Dickon looking at me,"" said Colin; ""I want to seehim.""""I'm glad you said that,"" answered Mary, ""because—because—""Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tellhim. Colin knew something new was coming.""Because what?"" he cried eagerly.Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him andcaught hold of both his hands.""Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can Itrust you—for sure—for sure?"" she implored.Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.""Yes—yes!""""Well, Dickon will come to see you to-morrow morning, and he'll bringhis creatures with him.""""Oh! Oh!"" Colin cried out in delight.""But that's not all,"" Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.""The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It isunder the ivy on the wall.""If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted""Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!"" but he was weak and rather hysterical; hiseyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.""Oh! Mary!"" he cried out with a half sob. ""Shall I see it? Shall I getinto it? Shall I live to get into it?"" and he clutched her hands anddragged her toward him.""Of course you'll see it!"" snapped Mary indignantly. ""Of course you'lllive to get into it! Don't be silly!""And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she broughthim to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutesafterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what sheimagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, andColin's aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listeningenraptured.""It is just what you thought it would be,"" he said at last. ""It soundsjust as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when you told mefirst.""Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth.""I had seen it—and I had been in,"" she said. ""I found the key and gotin weeks ago. But I daren't tell you—I daren't because I was so afraidI couldn't trust you—for sure!"""

He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurredand he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on hisbed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into freshsobbing at the least word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested thedifficulties of these visits. On this occasion he was away fromMisselthwaite Manor until afternoon.""How is he?"" he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived. ""Hewill break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The boy is halfinsane with hysteria and self-indulgence.""""Well, sir,"" answered Mrs. Medlock, ""you'll scarcely believe your eyeswhen you see him. That plain sour-faced child that's almost as bad ashimself has just bewitched him. How she's done it there's no telling.The Lord knows she's nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear herspeak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just flew at him like alittle cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stopscreaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop,and this afternoon—well just come up and see, sir. It's pastcrediting.""The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient's room wasindeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door heheard laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in hisdressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picturein one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at thatmoment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was soglowing with enjoyment.""Those long spires of blue ones—we'll have a lot of those,"" Colin wasannouncing. ""They're called Del-phin-iums.""""Dickon says they're larkspurs made big and grand,"" cried Mistress Mary.""There are clumps there already.""Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colinlooked fretful.""I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,"" Dr. Craven said atrifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.""I'm better now—much better,"" Colin answered, rather like a Rajah.""I'm going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine. I want somefresh air.""Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at himcuriously.""It must be a very fine day,"" he said, ""and you must be very careful notto tire yourself.""""Fresh air won't tire me,"" said the young Rajah.As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shriekedaloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold andkill him, it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhatstartled.""I thought you did not like fresh air,"" he said.""I don't when I am by myself,"" replied the Rajah; ""but my cousin isgoing out with me.""""And the nurse, of course?"" suggested Dr. Craven.""No, I will not have the nurse,"" so magnificently that Mary could nothelp remembering how the young native Prince had looked with hisdiamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great rubieson the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to approachwith salaams and receive his orders.""My cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she iswith me. She made me better last night. A very strong boy I know willpush my carriage.""Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy shouldchance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheritingMisselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weakone, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.""He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,"" he said. ""And I must knowsomething about him. Who is he? What is his name?""""It's Dickon,"" Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that everybodywho knew the moor must know Dickon. And she was right, too. She saw thatin a moment Dr. Craven's serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.""Oh, Dickon,"" he said. ""If it is Dickon you will be safe enough. He's asstrong as a moor pony, is Dickon.""""And he's trusty,"" said Mary. ""He's th' trustiest lad i' Yorkshire."" Shehad been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she forgot herself.""Did Dickon teach you that?"" asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.""I'm learning it as if it was French,"" said Mary rather coldly. ""It'slike a native dialect in India. Very clever people try to learn them. Ilike it and so does Colin.""""Well, well,"" he said. ""If it amuses you perhaps it won't do you anyharm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?""""No,"" Colin answered. ""I wouldn't take it at first and after Mary mademe quiet she talked me to sleep—in a low voice—about the springcreeping into a garden.""""That sounds soothing,"" said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever andglancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking downsilently at the carpet. ""You are evidently better, but you mustremember—""""I don't want to remember,"" interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.""When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere andI think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were illinstead of remembering it I would have him brought here."" And he waved athin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signetrings made of rubies. ""It is because my cousin makes me forget that shemakes me better.""Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a ""tantrum""; usuallyhe was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.This afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders andhe was spared any disagreeable scenes. When he went down-stairs helooked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the libraryshe felt that he was a much puzzled man.""Well, sir,"" she ventured, ""could you have believed it?""""It is certainly a new state of affairs,"" said the doctor. ""And there'sno denying it is better than the old one.""""I believe Susan Sowerby's right—I do that,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""Istopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit oftalk with her. And she says to me, 'Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn't be agood child, an' she mayn't be a pretty one, but she's a child, an'children needs children.' We went to school together, Susan Sowerby andme.""""She's the best sick nurse I know,"" said Dr. Craven. ""When I find her ina cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.""Mrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.""She's got a way with her, has Susan,"" she went on quite volubly. ""I'vebeen thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday. She says,'Once when I was givin' th' children a bit of a preach after they'd beenfightin' I ses to 'em all, ""When I was at school my jography told asth' world was shaped like a orange an' I found out before I was tenthat th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody. No one owns more thanhis bit of a quarter an' there's times it seems like there's not enowquarters to go round. But don't you—none o' you—think as you own th'whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an' you won't find itout without hard knocks."" What children learns from children,' she says,'is that there's no sense in grabbin' at th' whole orange—peel an' all.If you do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's too bitter toeat.'""""She's a shrewd woman,"" said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.""Well, she's got a way of saying things,"" ended Mrs. Medlock, muchpleased. ""Sometimes I've said to her, 'Eh! Susan, if you was a differentwoman an' didn't talk such broad Yorkshire I've seen the times when Ishould have said you was clever.'""That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened hiseyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it—smiledbecause he felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to beawake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He feltas if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and lethim go. He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerveshad relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at thewall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans heand Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon andhis wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to think about. And hehad not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet runningalong the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute she was inthe room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a waft offresh air full of the scent of the morning.""You've been out! You've been out! There's that nice smell of leaves!""he cried.She had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was brightwith the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it.""It's so beautiful!"" she said, a little breathless with her speed. ""Younever saw anything so beautiful! It has come! I thought it had comethat other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has come,the Spring! Dickon says so!""""Has it?"" cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it hefelt his heart beat. He actually sat up in bed.""Open the window!"" he added, laughing half with joyful excitement andhalf at his own fancy. ""Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!""And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in amoment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents andbirds' songs were pouring through.""That's fresh air,"" she said. ""Lie on your back and draw in long breathsof it. That's what Dickon does when he's lying on the moor. He says hefeels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if hecould live forever and ever. Breathe it and breathe it.""She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin'sfancy.""'Forever and ever'! Does it make him feel like that?"" he said, and hedid as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over againuntil he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening tohim.Mary was at his bedside again.""Things are crowding up out of the earth,"" she ran on in a hurry. ""Andthere are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veilhas covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry abouttheir nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are evenfighting for places in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look aswick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, andthe seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crowand the squirrels and a new-born lamb.""And then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found threedays before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor.It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to dowith it. He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he hadlet it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk. It was a softthing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body.Dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottlewas in his pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a treewith its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she weretoo full of strange joy to speak. A lamb—a lamb! A living lamb who layon your lap like a baby!She was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawingin long breaths of air when the nurse entered. She started a little atthe sight of the open window. She had sat stifling in the room many awarm day because her patient was sure that open windows gave peoplecold.""Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?"" she inquired.""No,"" was the answer. ""I am breathing long breaths of fresh air. Itmakes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast and mycousin will have breakfast with me.""The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for twobreakfasts. She found the servants' hall a more amusing place than theinvalid's chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news fromup-stairs. There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular youngrecluse who, as the cook said, ""had found his master, and good for him.""The servants' hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler,who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his opinionthat the invalid would be all the better ""for a good hiding.""When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon thetable he made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-likemanner.""A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb,are coming to see me this morning. I want them brought up-stairs as soonas they come,"" he said. ""You are not to begin playing with the animalsin the servants' hall and keep them there. I want them here.""The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.""Yes, sir,"" she answered.""I'll tell you what you can do,"" added Colin, waving his hand. ""You cantell Martha to bring them here. The boy is Martha's brother. His name isDickon and he is an animal charmer.""""I hope the animals won't bite, Master Colin,"" said the nurse.""I told you he was a charmer,"" said Colin austerely. ""Charmers' animalsnever bite.""""There are snake-charmers in India,"" said Mary; ""and they can put theirsnakes' heads in their mouths.""""Goodness!"" shuddered the nurse.They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.Colin's breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with seriousinterest.""You will begin to get fatter just as I did,"" she said. ""I never wantedmy breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.""""I wanted mine this morning,"" said Colin. ""Perhaps it was the fresh air.When do you think Dickon will come?""He was not long in coming. In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand.""Listen!"" she said. ""Did you hear a caw?""Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hearinside a house, a hoarse ""caw-caw.""""Yes,"" he answered.""That's Soot,"" said Mary. ""Listen again! Do you hear a bleat—a tinyone?""""Oh, yes!"" cried Colin, quite flushing.""That's the new-born lamb,"" said Mary. ""He's coming.""Dickon's moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried towalk quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the longcorridors. Mary and Colin heard him marching—marching, until he passedthrough the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin's own passage.""If you please, sir,"" announced Martha, opening the door, ""if youplease, sir, here's Dickon an' his creatures.""Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was inhis arms and the little red fox trotted by his side. Nut sat on his leftshoulder and Soot on his right and Shell's head and paws peeped out ofhis coat pocket.Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared—as he had stared when hefirst saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight. The truthwas that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understoodwhat this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow and hissquirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness thatthey seemed almost to be part of himself. Colin had never talked to aboy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure andcuriosity that he did not even think of speaking.But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. He had not feltembarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had onlystared and had not spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures werealways like that until they found out about you. He walked over toColin's sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his lap, andimmediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gownand began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curledhead with soft impatience against his side. Of course no boy could havehelped speaking then.""What is it doing?"" cried Colin. ""What does it want?""""It wants its mother,"" said Dickon, smiling more and more. ""I brought itto thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha'd like to see it feed.""He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket.""Come on, little 'un,"" he said, turning the small woolly white head witha gentle brown hand. ""This is what tha's after. Tha'll get more out o'this than tha' will out o' silk velvet coats. There now,"" and he pushedthe rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb beganto suck it with ravenous ecstasy.After that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb fellasleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He told themhow he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago.He had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching himswing higher and higher into the sky until he was only a speck in theheights of blue.""I'd almost lost him but for his song an' I was wonderin' how a chapcould hear it when it seemed as if he'd get out o' th' world in aminute—an' just then I heard somethin' else far off among th' gorsebushes. It was a weak bleatin' an' I knowed it was a new lamb as washungry an' I knowed it wouldn't be hungry if it hadn't lost its mothersomehow, so I set off searchin'. Eh! I did have a look for it. I went inan' out among th' gorse bushes an' round an' round an' I always seemedto take th' wrong turnin'. But at last I seed a bit o' white by a rockon top o' th' moor an' I climbed up an' found th' little 'un half deadwi' cold an' clemmin'.""While he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window andcawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions intothe big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches.Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug frompreference.They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew allthe flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones werealready growing in the secret garden.""I couldna' say that there name,"" he said, pointing to one under whichwas written ""Aquilegia,"" ""but us calls that a columbine, an' that thereone it's a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these isgarden ones an' they're bigger an' grander. There's some big clumps o'columbine in th' garden. They'll look like a bed o' blue an' whitebutterflies flutterin' when they're out.""""I'm going to see them,"" cried Colin. ""I am going to see them!""""Aye, that tha' mun,"" said Mary quite seriously. ""An tha' munnot lose notime about it."""

The things he had to tell about otters'and badgers' and water-rats' houses, not to mention birds' nests andfield-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremblewith excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animalcharmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the wholebusy underworld was working.""They're same as us,"" said Dickon, ""only they have to build their homesevery year. An' it keeps 'em so busy they fair scuffle to get 'emdone.""The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be madebefore Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden.No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turneda certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside theivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed inhis feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of itsgreatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever suspect thatthey had a secret. People must think that he was simply going out withMary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object to theirlooking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks about theirroute. They would go up this path and down that one and cross the otherand go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking atthe ""bedding-out plants"" the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been havingarranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one wouldthink it at all mysterious. They would turn into the shrubbery walks andlose themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost asserious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by greatgenerals in time of war.Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in theinvalid's apartments had of course filtered through the servants' hallinto the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstandingthis, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from MasterColin's room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartmentno outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak tohim.""Well, well,"" he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,""what's to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn't to be looked atcalling up a man he's never set eyes on.""Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a glimpseof the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncannylooks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenestwas that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous fancifuldescriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by people whohad never seen him.""Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,"" said Mrs. Medlock, asshe led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened thehitherto mysterious chamber.""Let's hope they're changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,"" heanswered.""They couldn't well change for the worse,"" she continued; ""and queer asit all is there's them as finds their duties made a lot easier to standup under. Don't you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in themiddle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby's Dickon more at home than youor me could ever be.""There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privatelybelieved. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently.""He'd be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,""he said. ""And yet it's not impudence, either. He's just fine, is thatlad.""It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled.When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite athome perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entranceof a visitor by saying ""Caw—Caw"" quite loudly. In spite of Mrs.Medlock's warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficientlyundignified to jump backward.The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa. He was sitting in anarmchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail infeeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle. Asquirrel was perched on Dickon's bent back attentively nibbling a nut.The little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.""Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,"" said Mrs. Medlock.The young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over—at least that waswhat the head gardener felt happened.""Oh, you are Roach, are you?"" he said. ""I sent for you to give you somevery important orders.""""Very good, sir,"" answered Roach, wondering if he was to receiveinstructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform theorchards into water-gardens.""I am going out in my chair this afternoon,"" said Colin. ""If the freshair agrees with me I may go out every day. When I go, none of thegardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. Noone is to be there. I shall go out about two o'clock and every one mustkeep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.""""Very good, sir,"" replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaksmight remain and that the orchards were safe.""Mary,"" said Colin, turning to her, ""what is that thing you say in Indiawhen you have finished talking and want people to go?""""You say, 'You have my permission to go,'"" answered Mary.The Rajah waved his hand.""You have my permission to go, Roach,"" he said. ""But, remember, this isvery important.""""Caw—Caw!"" remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.""Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,"" said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock tookhim out of the room.Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he smileduntil he almost laughed.""My word!"" he said, ""he's got a fine lordly way with him, hasn't he?You'd think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one—Prince Consortand all.""""Eh!"" protested Mrs. Medlock, ""we've had to let him trample all overevery one of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that's what folkswas born for.""""Perhaps he'll grow out of it, if he lives,"" suggested Mr. Roach.""Well, there's one thing pretty sure,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""If he doeslive and that Indian child stays here I'll warrant she teaches him thatthe whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says. Andhe'll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter.""Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.""It's all safe now,"" he said. ""And this afternoon I shall see it—thisafternoon I shall be in it!""Dickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary stayed withColin. She did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet beforetheir lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it. Shewondered why and asked him about it.""What big eyes you've got, Colin,"" she said. ""When you are thinking theyget as big as saucers. What are you thinking about now?""""I can't help thinking about what it will look like,"" he answered.""The garden?"" asked Mary.""The springtime,"" he said. ""I was thinking that I've really never seenit before. I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked atit. I didn't even think about it.""""I never saw it in India because there wasn't any,"" said Mary.Shut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more imagination thanshe had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking atwonderful books and pictures.""That morning when you ran in and said 'It's come! It's come!' you mademe feel quite queer. It sounded as if things were coming with a greatprocession and big bursts and wafts of music. I've a picture like it inone of my books—crowds of lovely people and children with garlands andbranches with blossoms on them, every one laughing and dancing andcrowding and playing on pipes. That was why I said, 'Perhaps we shallhear golden trumpets' and told you to throw open the window.""""How funny!"" said Mary. ""That's really just what it feels like. And ifall the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creaturesdanced past at once, what a crowd it would be! I'm sure they'd dance andsing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.""They both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable butbecause they both so liked it.A little later the nurse made Colin ready. She noticed that instead oflying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made someefforts to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary all thetime.""This is one of his good days, sir,"" she said to Dr. Craven, whodropped in to inspect him. ""He's in such good spirits that it makes himstronger.""""I'll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has come in,"" saidDr. Craven. ""I must see how the going out agrees with him. I wish,"" in avery low voice, ""that he would let you go with him.""""I'd rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here whileit's suggested,"" answered the nurse with sudden firmness.""I hadn't really decided to suggest it,"" said the doctor, with hisslight nervousness. ""We'll try the experiment. Dickon's a lad I'd trustwith a new-born child.""The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down-stairs and put himin his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside. After themanservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his handto him and to the nurse.""You have my permission to go,"" he said, and they both disappearedquickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely insidethe house.Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily. MistressMary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to thesky. The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemedlike white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strangewith a wild clear scented sweetness. Colin kept lifting his thin chestto draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they which werelistening—listening, instead of his ears.""There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,"" hesaid. ""What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?""""It's gorse on th' moor that's openin' out,"" answered Dickon. ""Eh! th'bees are at it wonderful to-day.""Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took.In fact every gardener or gardener's lad had been witched away. But theywound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountainbeds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysteriouspleasure of it. But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by theivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, forsome curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak inwhispers.""This is it,"" breathed Mary. ""This is where I used to walk up and downand wonder and wonder.""""Is it?"" cried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with eagercuriousness. ""But I can see nothing,"" he whispered. ""There is no door.""""That's what I thought,"" said Mary.Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.""That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,"" said Mary.""Is it?"" said Colin.A few yards more and Mary whispered again.""This is where the robin flew over the wall,"" she said.""Is it?"" cried Colin. ""Oh! I wish he'd come again!""""And that,"" said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilacbush, ""is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me thekey.""Then Colin sat up.""Where? Where? There?"" he cried, and his eyes were as big as the wolf'sin Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark onthem. Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.""And this,"" said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, ""iswhere I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of thewall. And this is the ivy the wind blew back,"" and she took hold of thehanging green curtain.""Oh! is it—is it!"" gasped Colin.""And here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him in—pushhim in quickly!""And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though hegasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and heldthem there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chairstopped as if by magic and the door was closed. Not till then did hetake them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary haddone. And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays andtendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and inthe grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here andthere everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and whiteand the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there werefluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents andscents. And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovelytouch. And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He lookedso strange and different because a pink glow of color had actuallycrept all over him—ivory face and neck and hands and all.""I shall get well! I shall get well!"" he cried out. ""Mary! Dickon! Ishall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!"""

One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemndawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far backand looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing andflushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almostmakes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchangingmajesty of the rising of the sun—which has been happening every morningfor thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One knows it thenfor a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one stands byoneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillnessslanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly againand again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries. Thensometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions ofstars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound offar-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one's eyes.And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt theSpringtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That afternoonthe whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantlybeautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness thespring came and crowded everything it possibly could into that oneplace. More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and stood stillwith a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head softly.""Eh! it is graidely,"" he said. ""I'm twelve goin' on thirteen an' there'sa lot o' afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I never seedone as graidely as this 'ere.""""Aye, it is a graidely one,"" said Mary, and she sighed for mere joy.""I'll warrant it's th' graidelest one as ever was in this world.""""Does tha' think,"" said Colin with dreamy carefulness, ""as happen it wasmade loike this 'ere all o' purpose for me?""""My word!"" cried Mary admiringly, ""that there is a bit o' goodYorkshire. Tha'rt shapin' first-rate—that tha' art.""And delight reigned.They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white withblossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king's canopy, a fairyking's. There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whosebuds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky lookeddown like wonderful eyes.Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them.They brought him things to look at—buds which were opening, buds whichwere tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green,the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the emptyshell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly roundand round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look atwonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees. It waslike being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queenand shown all the mysterious riches it contained.""I wonder if we shall see the robin?"" said Colin.""Tha'll see him often enow after a bit,"" answered Dickon. ""When th' eggshatches out th' little chap he'll be kep' so busy it'll make his headswim. Tha'll see him flyin' backward an' for'ard carryin' worms nigh asbig as himsel' an' that much noise goin' on in th' nest when he getsthere as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to dropth' first piece in. An' gapin' beaks an' squawks on every side. Mothersays as when she sees th' work a robin has to keep them gapin' beaksfilled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin' to do. She says she'sseen th' little chaps when it seemed like th' sweat must be droppin' off'em, though folk can't see it.""This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to covertheir mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voicesseveral days before. He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best,but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never tolaugh above a whisper.Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour thesunshine grew more golden. The wheeled chair had been drawn back underthe canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn outhis pipe when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.""That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?"" he said.Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there wasa brief moment of stillness.""Yes,"" answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very gentlesound.Mary gazed at the tree and thought.""The branches are quite gray and there's not a single leaf anywhere,""Colin went on. ""It's quite dead, isn't it?""""Aye,"" admitted Dickon. ""But them roses as has climbed all over it willnear hide every bit o' th' dead wood when they're full o' leaves an'flowers. It won't look dead then. It'll be th' prettiest of all.""Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.""It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,"" said Colin. ""I wonderhow it was done.""""It's been done many a year,"" answered Dickon. ""Eh!"" with a suddenrelieved start and laying his hand on Colin. ""Look at that robin! Therehe is! He's been foragin' for his mate.""Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash ofred-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through thegreenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colinleaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.""He's taking her tea to her. Perhaps it's five o'clock. I think I'd likesome tea myself.""And so they were safe.""It was Magic which sent the robin,"" said Mary secretly to Dickonafterward. ""I know it was Magic."" For both she and Dickon had beenafraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had brokenoff ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon hadstood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.""We mun look as if it wasn't no different from th' other trees,"" he hadsaid. ""We couldn't never tell him how it broke, poor lad. If he saysanything about it we mun—we mun try to look cheerful.""""Aye, that we mun,"" had answered Mary.But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at thetree. She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was anyreality in that other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on rubbing hisrust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun togrow in his blue eyes.""Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,"" he had gone on ratherhesitatingly. ""An' mother she thinks maybe she's about Misselthwaitemany a time lookin' after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do whenthey're took out o' th' world. They have to come back, tha' sees. Happenshe's been in the garden an' happen it was her set us to work, an' toldus to bring him here.""Mary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a greatbeliever in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked Magic,of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why peopleliked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend. Shewondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought therobin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question.She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colinlook like an entirely different boy. It did not seem possible that hecould be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten hispillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to change. The faint glow ofcolor which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first gotinside the garden really never quite died away. He looked as if he weremade of flesh instead of ivory or wax.They saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it wasso suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.""Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to therhododendron walk,"" he said. ""And then you and Dickon can bring ithere.""It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white clothwas spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets,a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domesticerrands paused to inquire what was going on and were led intoinvestigating crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up treeswith pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpetinto a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and madehoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully inone gulp.The afternoon was dragging toward its mellow hour. The sun was deepeningthe gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds wereflying past less often. Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, thetea-basket was re-packed ready to be taken back to the house, and Colinwas lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from hisforehead and his face looking quite a natural color.""I don't want this afternoon to go,"" he said; ""but I shall come backto-morrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.""""You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?"" said Mary.""I'm going to get nothing else,"" he answered. ""I've seen the spring nowand I'm going to see the summer. I'm going to see everything grow here.I'm going to grow here myself.""""That tha' will,"" said Dickon. ""Us'll have thee walkin' about here an'diggin' same as other folk afore long.""Colin flushed tremendously.""Walk!"" he said. ""Dig! Shall I?""Dickon's glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor Mary hadever asked if anything was the matter with his legs.""For sure tha' will,"" he said stoutly. ""Tha'—tha's got legs o' thineown, same as other folks!""Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin's answer.""Nothing really ails them,"" he said, ""but they are so thin and weak.They shake so that I'm afraid to try to stand on them.""Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.""When tha' stops bein' afraid tha'lt stand on 'em,"" Dickon said withrenewed cheer. ""An' tha'lt stop bein' afraid in a bit.""""I shall?"" said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering aboutthings.They were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was droppinglower. It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they reallyhad had a busy and exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he wereresting luxuriously. Even the creatures had ceased moving about and haddrawn together and were resting near them. Soot had perched on a lowbranch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over hiseyes. Mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a minute.In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin halflifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:""Who is that man?""Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.""Man!"" they both cried in low quick voices.Colin pointed to the high wall.""Look!"" he whispered excitedly. ""Just look!""Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff'sindignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!He actually shook his fist at Mary.""If I wasn't a bachelder, an' tha' was a wench o' mine,"" he cried, ""I'dgive thee a hidin'!""He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energeticintention to jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him heevidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his laddershaking his fist down at her.""I never thowt much o' thee!"" he harangued. ""I couldna' abide thee th'first time I set eyes on thee. A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom,allus askin' questions an' pokin' tha' nose where it wasna' wanted. Inever knowed how tha' got so thick wi' me. If it hadna' been for th'robin—Drat him—""""Ben Weatherstaff,"" called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood belowhim and called up to him with a sort of gasp. ""Ben Weatherstaff, it wasthe robin who showed me the way!""Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of thewall, he was so outraged.""Tha' young bad 'un!"" he called down at her. ""Layin' tha' badness on arobin,—not but what he's impidint enow for anythin'. Him showin' theeth' way! Him! Eh! tha' young nowt,""—she could see his next words burstout because he was overpowered by curiosity—""however i' this world didtha' get in?""""It was the robin who showed me the way,"" she protested obstinately. ""Hedidn't know he was doing it but he did. And I can't tell you from herewhile you're shaking your fist at me.""He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and hisjaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he sawcoming over the grass toward him.At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprisedthat he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But inthe midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously toDickon.""Wheel me over there!"" he commanded. ""Wheel me quite close and stopright in front of him!""And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and whichmade his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robeswhich came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coachbecause a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his greatblack-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him.And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff's nose. It was really nowonder his mouth dropped open.""Do you know who I am?"" demanded the Rajah.How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on whatwas before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed andgulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word.""Do you know who I am?"" demanded Colin still more imperiously. ""Answer!""Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes andover his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice.""Who tha' art?"" he said. ""Aye, that I do—wi' tha' mother's eyes starin'at me out o' tha' face. Lord knows how tha' come here. But tha'rt th'poor cripple.""Colin forgot that he had ever had a back. His face flushed scarlet andhe sat bolt upright.""I'm not a cripple!"" he cried out furiously. ""I'm not!""""He's not!"" cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her fierceindignation. ""He's not got a lump as big as a pin! I looked and therewas none there—not one!""Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as ifhe could never gaze enough. His hand shook and his mouth shook and hisvoice shook. He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and hecould only remember the things he had heard.""Tha'—tha' hasn't got a crooked back?"" he said hoarsely.""No!"" shouted Colin.""Tha'—tha' hasn't got crooked legs?"" quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.It was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into histantrums rushed through him now in a new way. Never yet had he beenaccused of crooked legs—even in whispers—and the perfectly simplebelief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff's voicewas more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure. His anger and insultedpride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him witha power he had never known before, an almost unnatural strength.""Come here!"" he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear thecoverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself. ""Come here! Comehere! This minute!""Dickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught her breath in a shortgasp and felt herself turn pale.""He can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!"" she gabbled over toherself under her breath as fast as ever she could.There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on to theground, Dickon held Colin's arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feetwere on the grass. Colin was standing upright—upright—as straight asan arrow and looking strangely tall—his head thrown back and hisstrange eyes flashing lightning.""Look at me!"" he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. ""Just look at me—you!Just look at me!""""He's as straight as I am!"" cried Dickon. ""He's as straight as any ladi' Yorkshire!""What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He chokedand gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as hestruck his old hands together.""Eh!"" he burst forth, ""th' lies folk tells! Tha'rt as thin as a lath an'as white as a wraith, but there's not a knob on thee. Tha'lt make a monyet. God bless thee!""Dickon held Colin's arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter. Hestood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face.""I'm your master,"" he said, ""when my father is away. And you are to obeyme. This is my garden. Don't dare to say a word about it! You get downfrom that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will meet youand bring you here. I want to talk to you. We did not want you, but nowyou will have to be in the secret. Be quick!""Ben Weatherstaff's crabbed old face was still wet with that one queerrush of tears. It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thinstraight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.""Eh! lad,"" he almost whispered. ""Eh! my lad!"" And then rememberinghimself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said, ""Yes,sir! Yes, sir!"" and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder."

There were scarlet spots on hischeeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.""I can stand,"" he said, and his head was still held up and he said itquite grandly.""I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped bein' afraid,"" answeredDickon. ""An' tha's stopped.""""Yes, I've stopped,"" said Colin.Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.""Are you making Magic?"" he asked sharply.Dickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.""Tha's doin' Magic thysel',"" he said. ""It's same Magic as made these'ere work out o' th' earth,"" and he touched with his thick boot a clumpof crocuses in the grass.Colin looked down at them.""Aye,"" he said slowly, ""there couldna' be bigger Magic then thatthere—there couldna' be.""He drew himself up straighter than ever.""I'm going to walk to that tree,"" he said, pointing to one a few feetaway from him. ""I'm going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here. Ican rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I will sitdown, but not before. Bring a rug from the chair.""He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfullysteady. When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain thathe supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straightthat he looked tall.When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw himstanding there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.""What art sayin'?"" he asked rather testily because he did not want hisattention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proudface.But she did not tell him. What she was saying was this:""You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! Youcan do it! You can!""She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep himon his feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should give inbefore Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted by asudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness.He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.""Look at me!"" he commanded. ""Look at me all over! Am I a hunchback? HaveI got crooked legs?""Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he hadrecovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.""Not tha',"" he said. ""Nowt o' th' sort. What's tha' been doin' withthysel'—? hidin' out o' sight an' lettin' folk think tha' was cripplean' half-witted?""""Half-witted!"" said Colin angrily. ""Who thought that?""""Lots o' fools,"" said Ben. ""Th' world's full o' jackasses brayin' an'they never bray nowt but lies. What did tha' shut thysel' up for?""""Every one thought I was going to die,"" said Colin shortly. ""I'm not!""And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, upand down, down and up.""Tha' die!"" he said with dry exultation. ""Nowt o' th' sort! Tha's gottoo much pluck in thee. When I seed thee put tha' legs on th' ground insuch a hurry I knowed tha' was all right. Sit thee down on th' rug a bityoung Mester an' give me thy orders.""There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understandingin his manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could asthey had come down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be remembered, shehad told him, was that Colin was getting well—getting well. The gardenwas doing it. No one must let him remember about having humps and dying.The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.""What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?"" he inquired.""Anythin' I'm told to do,"" answered old Ben. ""I'm kep' on byfavor—because she liked me.""""She?"" said Colin.""Tha' mother,"" answered Ben Weatherstaff.""My mother?"" said Colin, and he looked about him quietly. ""This was hergarden, wasn't it?""""Aye, it was that!"" and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too. ""She weremain fond of it.""""It is my garden now, I am fond of it. I shall come here every day,""announced Colin. ""But it is to be a secret. My orders are that no one isto know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and made itcome alive. I shall send for you sometimes to help—but you must comewhen no one can see you.""Ben Weatherstaff's face twisted itself in a dry old smile.""I've come here before when no one saw me,"" he said.""What!"" exclaimed Colin. ""When?""""Th' last time I was here,"" rubbing his chin and looking round, ""wasabout two year' ago.""""But no one has been in it for ten years!"" cried Colin. ""There was nodoor!""""I'm no one,"" said old Ben dryly. ""An' I didn't come through th' door. Icome over th' wall. Th' rheumatics held me back th' last two year'.""""Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'!"" cried Dickon. ""I couldn't make outhow it had been done.""""She was so fond of it—she was!"" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly. ""An' shewas such a pretty young thing. She says to me once, 'Ben,' says shelaughin', 'if ever I'm ill or if I go away you must take care of myroses.' When she did go away th' orders was no one was ever to comenigh. But I come,"" with grumpy obstinacy. ""Over th' wall I come—untilth' rheumatics stopped me—an' I did a bit o' work once a year. She'dgave her order first.""""It wouldn't have been as wick as it is if tha' hadn't done it,"" saidDickon. ""I did wonder.""""I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff,"" said Colin. ""You'll know how tokeep the secret.""""Aye, I'll know, sir,"" answered Ben. ""An' it'll be easier for a man wi'rheumatics to come in at th' door.""On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretchedout his hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and hebegan to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough butpresently as they watched him—Mary with quite breathless interest—hedrove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.""You can do it! You can do it!"" said Mary to herself. ""I tell you, youcan!""Dickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not aword. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.Colin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spokeexultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.""Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk—an'tha' said tha'd have me diggin'. I thowt tha' was just leein' to pleaseme. This is only th' first day an' I've walked—an' here I am diggin'.""Ben Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he endedby chuckling.""Eh!"" he said, ""that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow. Tha'rt aYorkshire lad for sure. An' tha'rt diggin', too. How'd tha' like toplant a bit o' somethin'? I can get thee a rose in a pot.""""Go and get it!"" said Colin, digging excitedly. ""Quick! Quick!""It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his wayforgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper andwider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it. Maryslipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon haddeepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over. Helooked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely newexercise, slight as it was.""I want to do it before the sun goes quite—quite down,"" he said.Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just onpurpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from thegreenhouse. He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could. He had begunto be excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from themould.""Here, lad,"" he said, handing the plant to Colin. ""Set it in the earththysel' same as th' king does when he goes to a new place.""The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as heset the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.It was filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was leaningforward on her hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched forwardto see what was being done. Nut and Shell chattered about it from acherry-tree.""It's planted!"" said Colin at last. ""And the sun is only slipping overthe edge. Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it goes. That'spart of the Magic.""And Dickon helped him, and the Magic—or whatever it was—so gave himstrength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strangelovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his twofeet—laughing."

He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send someone out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to hisroom the poor man looked him over seriously.""You should not have stayed so long,"" he said. ""You must not overexertyourself.""""I am not tired at all,"" said Colin. ""It has made me well. To-morrow Iam going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.""""I am not sure that I can allow it,"" answered Dr. Craven. ""I am afraidit would not be wise.""""It would not be wise to try to stop me,"" said Colin quite seriously. ""Iam going.""Even Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief peculiarities was thathe did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with hisway of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert islandall his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his ownmanners and had had no one to compare himself with. Mary had indeedbeen rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite hadgradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind whichis usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally thought itof enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and looked at himcuriously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone. She wanted tomake him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did.""What are you looking at me for?"" he said.""I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.""""So am I,"" said Colin calmly, but not without an air of somesatisfaction. ""He won't get Misselthwaite at all now I'm not going todie.""""I'm sorry for him because of that, of course,"" said Mary, ""but I wasthinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to bepolite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never havedone it.""""Am I rude?"" Colin inquired undisturbedly.""If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,""said Mary, ""he would have slapped you.""""But he daren't,"" said Colin.""No, he daren't,"" answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quitewithout prejudice. ""Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn'tlike—because you were going to die and things like that. You were sucha poor thing.""""But,"" announced Colin stubbornly, ""I am not going to be a poor thing. Iwon't let people think I'm one. I stood on my feet this afternoon.""""It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,"" Mary wenton, thinking aloud.Colin turned his head, frowning.""Am I queer?"" he demanded.""Yes,"" answered Mary, ""very. But you needn't be cross,"" she addedimpartially, ""because so am I queer—and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But Iam not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before Ifound the garden.""""I don't want to be queer,"" said Colin. ""I am not going to be,"" and hefrowned again with determination.He was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary sawhis beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.""I shall stop being queer,"" he said, ""if I go every day to the garden.There is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure thereis.""""So am I,"" said Mary.""Even if it isn't real Magic,"" Colin said, ""we can pretend it is.Something is there—something!""""It's Magic,"" said Mary, ""but not black. It's as white as snow.""They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the monthsthat followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazingones. Oh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have neverhad a garden, you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden youwill know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came topass there. At first it seemed that green things would never ceasepushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even inthe crevices of the walls. Then the green things began to show buds andthe buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, everyshade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its happy daysflowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. BenWeatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar frombetween the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovelyclinging things to grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grassin sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armiesof the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbinesor campanulas.""She was main fond o' them—she was,"" Ben Weatherstaff said. ""She likedthem things as was allus pointin' up to th' blue sky, she used to tell.Not as she was one o' them as looked down on th' earth—not her. Shejust loved it but she said as th' blue sky allus looked so joyful.""The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tendedthem. Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score,gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and whichit might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people hadgot there. And the roses—the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangledround the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from theirbranches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with longgarlands falling in cascades—they came alive day by day, hour by hour.Fair fresh leaves, and buds—and buds—tiny at first but swelling andworking Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scentdelicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the gardenair.Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morninghe was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn't rain hespent in the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on thegrass ""watching things growing,"" he said. If you watched long enough, hedeclared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could makethe acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on variousunknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps ofstraw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they weretrees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country. A molethrowing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out atlast with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, hadabsorbed him one whole morning. Ants' ways, beetles' ways, bees' ways,frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave him a new world to exploreand when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes' ways, otters' ways,ferrets' ways, squirrels' ways, and trout's and water-rats' and badgers'ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.And this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really oncestood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary toldhim of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of itgreatly. He talked of it constantly.""Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,"" he said wiselyone day, ""but people don't know what it is like or how to make it.Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happenuntil you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.""The next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once forBen Weatherstaff. Ben came as quickly as he could and found the Rajahstanding on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also verybeautifully smiling.""Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,"" he said. ""I want you and Dickon andMiss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tellyou something very important.""""Aye, aye, sir!"" answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (Oneof the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his boyhoodhe had once run away to sea and had made voyages. So he could reply likea sailor.)""I am going to try a scientific experiment,"" explained the Rajah. ""WhenI grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am goingto begin now with this experiment.""""Aye, aye, sir!"" said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was thefirst time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at thisstage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had readabout a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincingsort of boy. When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on youit seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though hewas only ten years old—going on eleven. At this moment he wasespecially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination ofactually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.""The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,"" he went on, ""willbe about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knowsanything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little,because she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickonknows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn't know he knows it. He charmsanimals and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he hadnot been an animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boyis an animal. I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have notsense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us—likeelectricity and horses and steam.""This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited andreally could not keep still.""Aye, aye, sir,"" he said and he began to stand up quite straight.""When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,"" the oratorproceeded. ""Then something began pushing things up out of the soil andmaking things out of nothing. One day things weren't there and anotherthey were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel verycurious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to bescientific. I keep saying to myself, 'What is it? What is it?' It'ssomething. It can't be nothing! I don't know its name so I call itMagic. I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and fromwhat they tell me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it upand draws it. Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked upthrough the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of beinghappy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making mebreathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things outof nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowersand birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be allaround us. In this garden—in all the places. The Magic in this gardenhas made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man. I am goingto make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it inmyself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I don't know howto do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling itperhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. WhenI was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herselfas fast as she could, 'You can do it! You can do it!' and I did. I hadto try myself at the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me—andso did Dickon's. Every morning and evening and as often in the daytimeas I can remember I am going to say, 'Magic is in me! Magic is making mewell! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!' Andyou must all do it, too. That is my experiment. Will you help, BenWeatherstaff?""""Aye, aye, sir!"" said Ben Weatherstaff. ""Aye, aye!""""If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go throughdrill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experimentsucceeds. You learn things by saying them over and over and thinkingabout them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will bethe same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help youit will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.""""I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirswho said words over and over thousands of times,"" said Mary.""I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say th' same thing over thousands o'times—callin' Jem a drunken brute,"" said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.""Summat allus come o' that, sure enough. He gave her a good hidin' an'went to th' Blue Lion an' got as drunk as a lord.""Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he cheeredup.""Well,"" he said, ""you see something did come of it. She used the wrongMagic until she made him beat her. If she'd used the right Magic and hadsaid something nice perhaps he wouldn't have got as drunk as a lord andperhaps—perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.""Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his littleold eyes.""Tha'rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,"" hesaid. ""Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I'll give her a bit of a hint o'what Magic will do for her. She'd be rare an' pleased if th' sinetifik'speriment worked—an' so 'ud Jem.""Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining withcurious delight. Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held along-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softlywhile it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.""Do you think the experiment will work?"" Colin asked him, wondering whathe was thinking. He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when hesaw him looking at him or at one of his ""creatures"" with his happy widesmile.He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.""Aye,"" he answered, ""that I do. It'll work same as th' seeds do when th'sun shines on 'em. It'll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?""Colin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirsand devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sitcross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.""It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,"" said Colin. ""I'm rathertired and I want to sit down.""""Eh!"" said Dickon, ""tha' musn't begin by sayin' tha'rt tired. Tha' mightspoil th' Magic.""Colin turned and looked at him—into his innocent round eyes.""That's true,"" he said slowly. ""I must only think of the Magic.""It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in theircircle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led intoappearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in beingwhat he called ""agen' prayer-meetin's"" but this being the Rajah's affairhe did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at beingcalled upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured. Dickonheld his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer's signal noone heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow,the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part ofthe circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their owndesire.""The 'creatures' have come,"" said Colin gravely. ""They want to help us.""Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his head highas if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderfullook in them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.""Now we will begin,"" he said. ""Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary,as if we were dervishes?""""I canna' do no swayin' back'ard and for'ard,"" said Ben Weatherstaff.""I've got th' rheumatics.""""The Magic will take them away,"" said Colin in a High Priest tone, ""butwe won't sway until it has done it. We will only chant.""""I canna' do no chantin',"" said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. ""Theyturned me out o' th' church choir th' only time I ever tried it.""No one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin's face was noteven crossed by a shadow. He was thinking only of the Magic.""Then I will chant,"" he said. And he began, looking like a strange boyspirit. ""The sun is shining—the sun is shining. That is the Magic. Theflowers are growing—the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Beingalive is the Magic—being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in me—theMagic is in me. It is in me—it is in me. It's in every one of us. It'sin Ben Weatherstaff's back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!""He said it a great many times—not a thousand times but quite a goodlynumber. Mary listened entranced. She felt as if it were at once queerand beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff beganto feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable. Thehumming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice anddrowsily melted into a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbitasleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back. Soot hadpushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder, thegray film dropped over his eyes. At last Colin stopped.""Now I am going to walk round the garden,"" he announced.Ben Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with ajerk.""You have been asleep,"" said Colin.""Nowt o' th' sort,"" mumbled Ben. ""Th' sermon was good enow—but I'mbound to get out afore th' collection.""He was not quite awake yet.""You're not in church,"" said Colin.""Not me,"" said Ben, straightening himself. ""Who said I were? I heardevery bit of it. You said th' Magic was in my back. Th' doctor calls itrheumatics.""The Rajah waved his hand.""That was the wrong Magic,"" he said. ""You will get better. You have mypermission to go to your work. But come back to-morrow.""""I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,"" grunted Ben.It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being astubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made uphis mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and lookover the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were anystumbling.The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession wasformed. It really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head withDickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walkedbehind, and the ""creatures"" trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cubkeeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping tonibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felthimself in charge.It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few yardsit stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon's arm and privately BenWeatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his handfrom its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held up allthe time and he looked very grand.""The Magic is in me!"" he kept saying. ""The Magic is making me strong! Ican feel it! I can feel it!""It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him.He sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on thegrass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, buthe would not give up until he had gone all round the garden. When hereturned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he lookedtriumphant.""I did it! The Magic worked!"" he cried. ""That is my first scientificdiscovery.""""What will Dr. Craven say?"" broke out Mary.""He won't say anything,"" Colin answered, ""because he will not be told.This is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know anythingabout it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like anyother boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be takenback in it. I won't have people whispering and asking questions and Iwon't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quitesucceeded. Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shalljust walk into his study and say 'Here I am; I am like any other boy. Iam quite well and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by ascientific experiment.'""""He will think he is in a dream,"" cried Mary. ""He won't believe hiseyes.""Colin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he wasgoing to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he hadbeen aware of it. And the thought which stimulated him more than anyother was this imagining what his father would look like when he sawthat he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers'sons. One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days hadbeen his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father wasafraid to look at him.""He'll be obliged to believe them,"" he said. ""One of the things I amgoing to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientificdiscoveries, is to be an athlete.""""We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week or so,"" said BenWeatherstaff. ""Tha'lt end wi' winnin' th' Belt an' bein' championprize-fighter of all England.""Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.""Weatherstaff,"" he said, ""that is disrespectful. You must not takeliberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works Ishall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.""""Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir,"" answered Ben, touching his forehead insalute. ""I ought to have seed it wasn't a jokin' matter,"" but his eyestwinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He really did not mindbeing snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strengthand spirit."

Round thecottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wallof rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilightand on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked thereplanting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbsfor his mother. In the company of his ""creatures"" he did wonders thereand was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or weeded hewhistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot orCaptain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.""We'd never get on as comfortable as we do,"" Mrs. Sowerby said, ""if itwasn't for Dickon's garden. Anything'll grow for him. His 'taters andcabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavorwith 'em as nobody's has.""When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him.After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and thatwas her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look onand hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not onlyvegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flowerseeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberrybushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks andpansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whoseroots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps. Thelow wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he hadtucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowersinto every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones wereto be seen.""All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother,"" he would say, ""isto be friends with 'em for sure. They're just like th' 'creatures.' Ifthey're thirsty give 'em a drink and if they're hungry give 'em a bit o'food. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as ifI'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.""It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all thathappened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that""Mester Colin"" had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds withMiss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before itwas agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might ""comeinto the secret."" Somehow it was not doubted that she was ""safe forsure.""So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all thethrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray hazewhich had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had plannednever to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him,the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to thehidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angryface peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength,made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.""My word!"" she said. ""It was a good thing that little lass came to th'Manor. It's been th' makin' o' her an' th' savin' o' him. Standin' onhis feet! An' us all thinkin' he was a poor half-witted lad with not astraight bone in him.""She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deepthinking.""What do they make of it at th' Manor—him being so well an' cheerfulan' never complainin'?"" she inquired.""They don't know what to make of it,"" answered Dickon. ""Every day ascomes round his face looks different. It's fillin' out and doesn't lookso sharp an' th' waxy color is goin'. But he has to do his bit o'complainin',"" with a highly entertained grin.""What for, i' Mercy's name?"" asked Mrs. Sowerby.Dickon chuckled.""He does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened. If the doctorknew he'd found out he could stand on his feet he'd likely write andtell Mester Craven. Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself.He's goin' to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his fathercomes back an' then he's goin' to march into his room an' show him he'sas straight as other lads. But him an' Miss Mary thinks it's best planto do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now an' then to throw folk off th'scent.""Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he hadfinished his last sentence.""Eh!"" she said, ""that pair's enjoyin' theirselves, I'll warrant. They'llget a good bit o' play actin' out of it an' there's nothin' childrenlikes as much as play actin'. Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad.""Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyeswere twinkling with fun.""Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,"" heexplained. ""An' he flies out at John, th' footman, for not carryin' himcareful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin' as he can an' neverlifts his head until we're out o' sight o' th' house. An' he grunts an'frets a good bit when he's bein' settled into his chair. Him an' MissMary's both got to enjoyin' it an' when he groans an' complains she'llsay, 'Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so weak as that,poor Colin?'—but th' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keepfrom burstin' out laughin'. When we get safe into the garden they laughtill they've no breath left to laugh with. An' they have to stuff theirfaces into Mester Colin's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin',if any of 'em's about.""""Th' more they laugh th' better for 'em!"" said Mrs. Sowerby, stilllaughing herself. ""Good healthy child laughin's better than pills anyday o' th' year. That pair'll plump up for sure.""""They are plumpin' up,"" said Dickon. ""They're that hungry they don'tknow how to get enough to eat without makin' talk. Mester Colin says ifhe keeps sendin' for more food they won't believe he's an invalid atall. Miss Mary says she'll let him eat her share, but he says that ifshe goes hungry she'll get thin an' they mun both get fat at once.""Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty,that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickonlaughed with her.""I'll tell thee what, lad,"" Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak.""I've thought of a way to help 'em. When tha' goes to 'em in th'mornin's tha' shall take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake 'em acrusty cottage loaf or some buns wi' currants in 'em, same as youchildren like. Nothin's so good as fresh milk an' bread. Then they couldtake off th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their garden an'th' fine food they get indoors 'ud polish off th' corners.""""Eh! mother!"" said Dickon admiringly, ""what a wonder tha' art! Tha'always sees a way out o' things. They was quite in a pother yesterday.They didn't see how they was to manage without orderin' up morefood—they felt that empty inside.""""They're two young 'uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back to both of'em. Children like that feels like young wolves an' food's flesh an'blood to 'em,"" said Mrs. Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon's own curvingsmile. ""Eh! but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,"" she said.She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature—and shehad never been more so than when she said their ""play actin'"" would betheir joy. Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sourcesof entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion hadbeen unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and thenby Dr. Craven himself.""Your appetite is improving very much, Master Colin,"" the nurse had saidone day. ""You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed withyou.""""Nothing disagrees with me now,"" replied Colin, and then seeing thenurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps heought not to appear too well just yet. ""At least things don't so oftendisagree with me. It's the fresh air.""""Perhaps it is,"" said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystifiedexpression. ""But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.""""How she stared at you!"" said Mary when she went away. ""As if shethought there must be something to find out.""""I won't have her finding out things,"" said Colin. ""No one must begin tofind out yet."" When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled,also. He asked a number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance.""You stay out in the garden a great deal,"" he suggested. ""Where do yougo?""Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.""I will not let any one know where I go,"" he answered. ""I go to a placeI like. Every one has orders to keep out of the way. I won't be watchedand stared at. You know that!""""You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm—Ido not think so. The nurse says that you eat much more than you haveever done before.""""Perhaps,"" said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, ""perhaps it isan unnatural appetite.""""I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,"" said Dr.Craven. ""You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.""""Perhaps—perhaps I am bloated and feverish,"" said Colin, assuming adiscouraging air of gloom. ""People who are not going to live areoften—different.""Dr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin's wrist and he pushed uphis sleeve and felt his arm.""You are not feverish,"" he said thoughtfully, ""and such flesh as youhave gained is healthy. If we can keep this up, my boy, we need not talkof dying. Your father will be very happy to hear of this remarkableimprovement.""""I won't have him told!"" Colin broke forth fiercely. ""It will onlydisappoint him if I get worse again—and I may get worse this verynight. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning tohave one now. I won't have letters written to my father—I won't—Iwon't! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feelhot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much asI hate being stared at!""""Hush-h! my boy,"" Dr. Craven soothed him. ""Nothing shall be writtenwithout your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You mustnot undo the good which has been done.""He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse heprivately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned tothe patient.""The boy is extraordinarily better,"" he said. ""His advance seems almostabnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what wecould not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily andnothing must be said to irritate him.""Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. Fromthis time dated their plan of ""play actin'.""""I may be obliged to have a tantrum,"" said Colin regretfully. ""I don'twant to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into abig one. Perhaps I couldn't have one at all. That lump doesn't come inmy throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horribleones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to dosomething.""He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possibleto carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with anamazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast ofhome-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam andclotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they foundthemselves at the table—particularly if there were delicate slices ofsizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silvercover—they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.""I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,"" Colin alwaysended by saying. ""We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal ofthe dinner.""But they never found they could send away anything and the highlypolished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakenedmuch comment.""I do wish,"" Colin would say also, ""I do wish the slices of ham werethicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.""""It's enough for a person who is going to die,"" answered Mary when firstshe heard this, ""but it's not enough for a person who is going to live.I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heatherand gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.""The morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in thegarden for about two hours—went behind a big rose-bush and broughtforth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk withcream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currantbuns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tuckedin that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind, cleverwoman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious freshmilk!""Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,"" said Colin. ""It makes herthink of ways to do things—nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell herwe are grateful, Dickon—extremely grateful.""He was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He enjoyed them.He liked this so much that he improved upon it.""Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.""And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself withbuns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner ofany hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathingin moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him.This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen peopleto provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extraappetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of theirshillings to buy things.Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the parkoutside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wildcreatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort oftiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted eggswere a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt andfresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king—besides beingdeliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat asmany as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of themouths of fourteen people.Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle underthe plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves afterits brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always tookhis walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly foundpower at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk moresteadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magicgrew stronger—as well it might. He tried one experiment after anotheras he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him thebest things of all.""Yesterday,"" he said one morning after an absence, ""I went to Thwaitefor mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He's thestrongest chap on th' moor. He's the champion wrestler an' he can jumphigher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther. He's gone allth' way to Scotland for th' sports some years. He's knowed me ever sinceI was a little 'un an' he's a friendly sort an' I axed him somequestions. Th' gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o' thee, MesterColin, and I says, 'How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way,Bob? Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?' An' he says'Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite onceshowed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body.'An' I says, 'Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?'an' he laughed an' says, 'Art tha' th' delicate chap?' an' I says, 'No,but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of a long illness an'I wish I knowed some o' them tricks to tell him about.' I didn't say nonames an' he didn't ask none. He's friendly same as I said an' he stoodup an' showed me good-natured like, an' I imitated what he did till Iknowed it by heart.""Colin had been listening excitedly.""Can you show me?"" he cried. ""Will you?""""Aye, to be sure,"" Dickon answered, getting up. ""But he says tha' mun do'em gentle at first an' be careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in betweentimes an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo.""""I'll be careful,"" said Colin. ""Show me! Show me! Dickon, you are themost Magic boy in the world!""Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefullypractical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them withwidening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently hedid a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet. Marybegan to do them also. Soot, who was watching the performance, becamemuch disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly becausehe could not do them too.From that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much asthe Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more ofthem each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that butfor the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when hearrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow andMrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and thenurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with yourbreakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brimwith roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oat-cakesand buns and heather honey and clotted cream.""They are eating next to nothing,"" said the nurse. ""They'll die ofstarvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yetsee how they look.""""Look!"" exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. ""Eh! I'm moithered to deathwith them. They're a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets oneday and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook cantempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and breadsauce did they set a fork into yesterday—and the poor woman fairinvented a pudding for them—and back it's sent. She almost cried.She's afraid she'll be blamed if they starve themselves into theirgraves.""Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully. He wore anextremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showedhim the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to lookat—but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's sofa andexamined him. He had been called to London on business and had not seenthe boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain healththey gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left Colin's skin and a warmrose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollowsunder them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His once dark,heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from hisforehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were fuller and of anormal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmedinvalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his chin in his handand thought him over.""I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,"" he said. ""That willnot do. You will lose all you have gained—and you have gainedamazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.""""I told you it was an unnatural appetite,"" answered Colin.Mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queersound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almostchoking.""What is the matter?"" said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.Mary became quite severe in her manner.""It was something between a sneeze and a cough,"" she replied withreproachful dignity, ""and it got into my throat.""""But"" she said afterward to Colin, ""I couldn't stop myself. It justburst out because all at once I couldn't help remembering that last bigpotato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit throughthat thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.""""Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?"" Dr.Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.""There's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off thetrees,"" Mrs. Medlock answered. ""They stay out in the grounds all day andsee no one but each other. And if they want anything different to eatfrom what's sent up to them they need only ask for it.""""Well,"" said Dr. Craven, ""so long as going without food agrees with themwe need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.""""So is the girl,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""She's begun to be downright prettysince she's filled out and lost her ugly little sour look. Her hair'sgrown thick and healthy looking and she's got a bright color. Theglummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and MasterColin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps they'regrowing fat on that.""""Perhaps they are,"" said Dr. Craven. ""Let them laugh."""

In the robin's nest there were Eggs and the robin's mate satupon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and carefulwings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself wasindignantly watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown cornerin those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysteriousspell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that inthe garden there was nothing which was not quite likethemselves—nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of whatwas happening to them—the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breakingbeauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in thatgarden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that ifan Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round andcrash through space and come to an end—if there had been even one whodid not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happinesseven in that golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it andthe robin and his mate knew they knew it.At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For somemysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment heset his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger buta sort of robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin (which isa quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other). To speakrobin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman. Dickon alwaysspoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he used when hespoke to humans did not matter in the least. The robin thought he spokethis gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough tounderstand feathered speech. His movements also were robin. They neverstartled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening.Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was not evendisturbing.But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the othertwo. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden onhis legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wildanimals were thrown over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then when hebegan to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed wayand the others seemed to have to help him. The robin used to secretehimself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head tilted first on oneside and then on the other. He thought that the slow movements mightmean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do. When cats arepreparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly. The robintalked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but afterthat he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was sogreat that he was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly itwas an immense relief. But for a long time—or it seemed a long time tothe robin—he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the otherhumans did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sittingor lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting mannerto begin again.One day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learnto fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He hadtaken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest. Soit occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly—or rather towalk. He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the Eggswould probably conduct themselves in the same way after they werefledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested andderived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of hernest—though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer andlearn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans werealways more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemedreally to learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or ontree-tops.After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but allthree of the children at times did unusual things. They would standunder the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a waywhich was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. They wentthrough these movements at intervals every day and the robin was neverable to explain to his mate what they were doing or trying to do. Hecould only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about insuch a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently wasdoing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actionswere not of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his matehad ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercisesfor making the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not like humanbeings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so theydevelop themselves in a natural manner. If you have to fly about to findevery meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied (atrophiedmeans wasted away through want of use).When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding likethe others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace andcontent. Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that yourEggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the factthat you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a mostentertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs' mother sometimes felteven a little dull because the children did not come into the garden.But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull.One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin wasbeginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on hissofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had aninspiration.""Now that I am a real boy,"" Colin had said, ""my legs and arms and all mybody are so full of Magic that I can't keep them still. They want to bedoing things all the time. Do you know that when I waken in themorning, Mary, when it's quite early and the birds are just shoutingoutside and everything seems just shouting for joy—even the trees andthings we can't really hear—I feel as if I must jump out of bed andshout myself. And if I did it, just think what would happen!""Mary giggled inordinately.""The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running andthey would be sure you had gone crazy and they'd send for the doctor,""she said.Colin giggled himself. He could see how they would all look—howhorrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.""I wish my father would come home,"" he said. ""I want to tell him myself.I'm always thinking about it—but we couldn't go on like this muchlonger. I can't stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look toodifferent. I wish it wasn't raining to-day.""It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.""Colin,"" she began mysteriously, ""do you know how many rooms there arein this house?""""About a thousand, I suppose,"" he answered.""There's about a hundred no one ever goes into,"" said Mary. ""And onerainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them. No one everknew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I wascoming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor. That was thesecond time I heard you crying.""Colin started up on his sofa.""A hundred rooms no one goes into,"" he said. ""It sounds almost like asecret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. You could wheel me in mychair and nobody would know where we went.""""That's what I was thinking,"" said Mary. ""No one would dare to followus. There are galleries where you could run. We could do our exercises.There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivoryelephants. There are all sorts of rooms.""""Ring the bell,"" said Colin.When the nurse came in he gave his orders.""I want my chair,"" he said. ""Miss Mary and I are going to look at thepart of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as thepicture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he must go away andleave us alone until I send for him again.""Rainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman had wheeledthe chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together inobedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted. Assoon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to hisown quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.""I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,"" he said,""and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth'sexercises.""And they did all these things and many others. They looked at theportraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade andholding the parrot on her finger.""All these,"" said Colin, ""must be my relations. They lived a long timeago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, greataunts. She looks rather like you, Mary—not as you look now but as youlooked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and betterlooking.""""So are you,"" said Mary, and they both laughed.They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivoryelephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole inthe cushion the mouse had left but the mice had grown up and run awayand the hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more discoveriesthan Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They found new corridorsand corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked andweird old things they did not know the use of. It was a curiouslyentertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the samehouse with other people but at the same time feeling as if one weremiles away from them was a fascinating thing.""I'm glad we came,"" Colin said. ""I never knew I lived in such a bigqueer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day. Weshall always be finding new queer corners and things.""That morning they had found among other things such good appetites thatwhen they returned to Colin's room it was not possible to send theluncheon away untouched.When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she slapped it down on thekitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highlypolished dishes and plates.""Look at that!"" she said. ""This is a house of mystery, and those twochildren are the greatest mysteries in it.""""If they keep that up every day,"" said the strong young footman John,""there'd be small wonder that he weighs twice as much to-day as he did amonth ago. I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doingmy muscles an injury.""That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin'sroom. She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because shethought the change might have been made by chance. She said nothingto-day but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.She could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside. That wasthe change she noticed.""I know what you want me to tell you,"" said Colin, after she had stareda few minutes. ""I always know when you want me to tell you something.You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am going to keep itlike that.""""Why?"" asked Mary.""Because it doesn't make me angry any more to see her laughing. Iwakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if theMagic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that Icouldn't lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room wasquite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain andsomehow that made me go and pull the cord. She looked right down at meas if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there. Itmade me like to look at her. I want to see her laughing like that allthe time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.""""You are so like her now,"" said Mary, ""that sometimes I think perhapsyou are her ghost made into a boy.""That idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answeredher slowly.""If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me,"" he said.""Do you want him to be fond of you?"" inquired Mary.""I used to hate it because he was not fond of me. If he grew fond of meI think I should tell him about the Magic. It might make him morecheerful."""

After the morning'sincantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.""I like to do it,"" he explained, ""because when I grow up and make greatscientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and sothis is practise. I can only give short lectures now because I am veryyoung, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he was in churchand he would go to sleep.""""Th' best thing about lecturin',"" said Ben, ""is that a chap can get upan' say aught he pleases an' no other chap can answer him back. Iwouldn't be agen' lecturin' a bit mysel' sometimes.""But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes onhim and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection. Itwas not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs whichlooked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which helditself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which hadfilled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light heremembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gazemeant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting onand once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him.""What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?"" he asked.""I was thinkin',"" answered Ben, ""as I'd warrant tha's gone up three orfour pound this week. I was lookin' at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders.I'd like to get thee on a pair o' scales.""""It's the Magic and—and Mrs. Sowerby's buns and milk and things,"" saidColin. ""You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.""That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came hewas ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling thanusual. As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains theyfell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinkingrain. The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for theweeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves whichmust be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold. Colin was asgood at weeding as any one in these days and he could lecture while hewas doing it.""The Magic works best when you work yourself,"" he said this morning.""You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read booksabout bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. Iam making it up now. I keep finding out things.""It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his troweland stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes andthey had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did. Whenhe dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon asif a sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched himself outto his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly. Color glowedin his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness. All at once hehad realized something to the full.""Mary! Dickon!"" he cried. ""Just look at me!""They stopped their weeding and looked at him.""Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?"" hedemanded.Dickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he couldsee more things than most people could and many of them were things henever talked about. He saw some of them now in this boy.""Aye, that we do,"" he answered.Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing.""Just this minute,"" said Colin, ""all at once I remembered itmyself—when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel—and I had tostand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I'mwell—I'm well!""""Aye, that tha' art!"" said Dickon.""I'm well! I'm well!"" said Colin again, and his face went quite red allover.He had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and thoughtabout it, but just at that minute something had rushed all throughhim—a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been sostrong that he could not help calling out.""I shall live forever and ever and ever!"" he cried grandly. ""I shallfind out thousands and thousands of things. I shall find out aboutpeople and creatures and everything that grows—like Dickon—and I shallnever stop making Magic. I'm well! I'm well! I feel—I feel as if I wantto shout out something—something thankful, joyful!""Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced roundat him.""Tha' might sing th' Doxology,"" he suggested in his dryest grunt. He hadno opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with anyparticular reverence.But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about theDoxology.""What is that?"" he inquired.""Dickon can sing it for thee, I'll warrant,"" replied Ben Weatherstaff.Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer's smile.""They sing it i' church,"" he said. ""Mother says she believes th'skylarks sings it when they gets up i' th' mornin'.""""If she says that, it must be a nice song,"" Colin answered. "" I've neverbeen in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I wantto hear it.""Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood whatColin felt better than Colin did himself. He understood by a sort ofinstinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding. He pulledoff his cap and looked round still smiling.""Tha' must take off tha' cap,"" he said to Colin, ""an' so mun tha',Ben—an' tha' mun stand up, tha' knows.""Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair ashe watched Dickon intently. Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from hisknees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful lookon his old face as if he didn't know exactly why he was doing thisremarkable thing.Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing inquite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with hisjaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed onColin. Colin's face was thoughtful and appreciative.""It is a very nice song,"" he said. ""I like it. Perhaps it means justwhat I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.""He stopped and thought in a puzzled way. ""Perhaps they are both the samething. How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it again,Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It's my song. How doesit begin? 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow'?""And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices asmusically as they could and Dickon's swelled quite loud andbeautiful—and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared histhroat and at the third he joined in with such vigor that it seemedalmost savage and when the ""Amen"" came to an end Mary observed that thevery same thing had happened to him which had happened when he found outthat Colin was not a cripple—his chin was twitching and he was staringand winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet.""I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore,"" he said hoarsely, ""but Imay change my mind i' time. I should say tha'd gone up five pound thisweek, Mester Colin—five on 'em!""Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting hisattention and his expression had become a startled one.""Who is coming in here?"" he said quickly. ""Who is it?""The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman hadentered. She had come in with the last line of their song and she hadstood still listening and looking at them. With the ivy behind her, thesunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak,and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather likea softly colored illustration in one of Colin's books. She had wonderfulaffectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in—all of them, evenBen Weatherstaff and the ""creatures"" and every flower that was in bloom.Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt that she was anintruder at all. Dickon's eyes lighted like lamps.""It's Mother—that's who it is!"" he cried and he went across the grassat a run.Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him. They bothfelt their pulses beat faster.""It's Mother!"" Dickon said again when they met half-way. ""I knowed tha'wanted to see her an' I told her where th' door was hid.""Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but hiseyes quite devoured her face.""Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,"" he said, ""you and Dickon andthe secret garden. I'd never wanted to see any one or anything before.""The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her own.She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed tosweep over her eyes.""Eh! dear lad!"" she broke out tremulously. ""Eh! dear lad!"" as if she hadnot known she were going to say it. She did not say, ""Mester Colin,""but just ""dear lad"" quite suddenly. She might have said it to Dickon inthe same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her.Colin liked it.""Are you surprised because I am so well?"" he asked.She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.""Aye, that I am!"" she said; ""but tha'rt so like thy mother tha' made myheart jump.""""Do you think,"" said Colin a little awkwardly, ""that will make my fatherlike me?""""Aye, for sure, dear lad,"" she answered and she gave his shoulder a softquick pat. ""He mun come home—he mun come home.""""Susan Sowerby,"" said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her. ""Look atth' lad's legs, wilt tha'? They was like drumsticks i' stockin' twomonth' ago—an' I heard folk tell as they was bandy an' knock-kneed bothat th' same time. Look at 'em now!""Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.""They're goin' to be fine strong lad's legs in a bit,"" she said. ""Lethim go on playin' an' workin' in th' garden an' eatin' hearty an'drinkin' plenty o' good sweet milk an' there'll not be a finer pair i'Yorkshire, thank God for it.""She put both hands on Mistress Mary's shoulders and looked her littleface over in a motherly fashion.""An' thee, too!"" she said. ""Tha'rt grown near as hearty as our 'LizabethEllen. I'll warrant tha'rt like thy mother too. Our Martha told me asMrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman. Tha'lt be like a blush rosewhen tha' grows up, my little lass, bless thee.""She did not mention that when Martha came home on her ""day out"" anddescribed the plain sallow child she had said that she had no confidencewhatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard. ""It doesn't stand to reasonthat a pretty woman could be th' mother o' such a fou' little lass,"" shehad added obstinately.Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. Shehad only known that she looked ""different"" and seemed to have a greatdeal more hair and that it was growing very fast. But remembering herpleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hearthat she might some day look like her.Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the wholestory of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colinwalked on one side of her and Mary on the other. Each of them keptlooking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about thedelightful feeling she gave them—a sort of warm, supported feeling. Itseemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his ""creatures.""She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they werechildren. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew uponher shoulder as if it were Dickon's. When they told her about the robinand the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly littlemellow laugh in her throat.""I suppose learnin' 'em to fly is like learnin' children to walk, butI'm feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o'legs,"" she said.It was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorlandcottage way that at last she was told about the Magic.""Do you believe in Magic?"" asked Colin after he had explained aboutIndian fakirs. ""I do hope you do.""""That I do, lad,"" she answered. ""I never knowed it by that name but whatdoes th' name matter? I warrant they call it a different name i' Francean' a different one i' Germany. Th' same thing as set th' seeds swellin'an' th' sun shinin' made thee a well lad an' it's th' Good Thing. Itisn't like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of ournames. Th' Big Good Thing doesn't stop to worrit, bless thee. It goeson makin' worlds by th' million—worlds like us. Never thee stopbelievin' in th' Big Good Thing an' knowin' th' world's full of it—an'call it what tha' likes. Tha' wert singin' to it when I come into th'garden.""""I felt so joyful,"" said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes ather. ""Suddenly I felt how different I was—how strong my arms and legswere, you know—and how I could dig and stand—and I jumped up andwanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.""""Th' Magic listened when tha' sung th' Doxology. It would ha' listenedto anything tha'd sung. It was th' joy that mattered. Eh! lad,lad—what's names to th' Joy Maker,"" and she gave his shoulders a quicksoft pat again.She had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, andwhen the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hidingplace, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devourtheir food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She wasfull of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. She toldthem stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. She laughedas if she could not help it when they told her of the increasingdifficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretfulinvalid.""You see we can't help laughing nearly all the time when we aretogether,"" explained Colin. ""And it doesn't sound ill at all. We try tochoke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.""""There's one thing that comes into my mind so often,"" said Mary, ""and Ican scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly. I keep thinkingsuppose Colin's face should get to look like a full moon. It isn't likeone yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day—and suppose somemorning it should look like one—what should we do!""""Bless us all, I can see tha' has a good bit o' play actin' to do,"" saidSusan Sowerby. ""But tha' won't have to keep it up much longer. MesterCraven'll come home.""""Do you think he will?"" asked Colin. ""Why?""Susan Sowerby chuckled softly.""I suppose it 'ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha' toldhim in tha' own way,"" she said. ""Tha's laid awake nights plannin' it.""""I couldn't bear any one else to tell him,"" said Colin. ""I think aboutdifferent ways every day. I think now I just want to run into hisroom.""""That'd be a fine start for him,"" said Susan Sowerby. ""I'd like to seehis face, lad. I would that! He mun come back—that he mun.""One of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to hercottage. They planned it all. They were to drive over the moor and lunchout of doors among the heather. They would see all the twelve childrenand Dickon's garden and would not come back until they were tired.Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock. Itwas time for Colin to be wheeled back also. But before he got into hischair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with akind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold ofher blue cloak and held it fast.""You are just what I—what I wanted,"" he said. ""I wish you were mymother—as well as Dickon's!""All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm armsclose against the bosom under the blue cloak—as if he had been Dickon'sbrother. The quick mist swept over her eyes.""Eh! dear lad!"" she said. ""Thy own mother's in this 'ere very garden, Ido believe. She couldna' keep out of it. Thy father mun come back tothee—he mun!"""

Read Moreand friendship. At the start of the book, we are introduced to Mary Lennox, an unhappy and disagreeable child, who is left alone in a foreign land after a cholera outbreak claims the lives of her parents. Sent to England to live with her uncle, Mary quickly learns that she is largely forgotten and left to her own devices. The opening chapters reveal her initial encounters with the manor, including her disdain for her new surroundings and her brush with loneliness. This sets the stage for her growth and the adventures that await her as she discovers the hidden beauty of the garden and the connections she can form with others, ultimately transforming her character and outlook on life. ",物語は、孤児となり、謎めいたミッセルスウェイト荘で隠遁生活を送る叔父のもとで暮らすことになった、不機嫌で甘やかされた子供メアリー・レノックスを中心に展開する,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17396/images/cover-tb.jpg,IN THE GARDEN,"In each century since the beginning of the world wonderful things havebeen discovered. In the last century more amazing things were found outthan in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things stillmore astounding will be brought to light. At first people refuse tobelieve that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope itcan be done, then they see it can be done—then it is done and all theworld wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One of the new thingspeople began to find out in the last century was that thoughts—justmere thoughts—are as powerful as electric batteries—as good for one assunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. To let a sad thought or a badone get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germget into your body. If you let it stay there after it has got in you maynever get over it as long as you live.So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts abouther dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not tobe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly,bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very kind to her,though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push her about forher own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, andmoorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed oldgardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime andwith secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boyand his ""creatures,"" there was no room left for the disagreeablethoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellowand tired.So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of hisfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him andreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hystericalhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and thespring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand uponhis feet if he tried to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began to pushout the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ranhealthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood.His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there wasnothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen toany one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into hismind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by puttingin an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in oneplace.While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were comingalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-awaybeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountainsof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mindfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous;he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the darkones. He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain onmountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about himand flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them. Aterrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he hadlet his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately toallow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and desertedhis home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so broodedover him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people becauseit was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most strangersthought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime onhis soul. He was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders andthe name he always entered on hotel registers was, ""Archibald Craven,Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.""He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in hisstudy and told her she might have her ""bit of earth."" He had been in themost beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere morethan a few days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He hadbeen on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and hadlooked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them withsuch light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when herealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing hadhappened. He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he hadbeen walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted any man'ssoul out of shadow. He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his.But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on acarpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear little stream which ran quitemerrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbledover and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their heads to drink init and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like a thing aliveand yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. The valley wasvery, very still.As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Cravengradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valleyitself. He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not. He satand gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growingat its edge. There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing soclose to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he foundhimself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago.He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders ofblue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know that justthat simple thought was slowly filling his mind—filling and filling ituntil other things were softly pushed aside. It was as if a sweet clearspring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risenuntil at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he did notthink of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to growquieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicateblueness. He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening tohim, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowlyand stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath andwondering at himself. Something seemed to have been unbound and releasedin him, very quietly.""What is it?"" he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand overhis forehead. ""I almost feel as if—I were alive!""I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things tobe able to explain how this had happened to him. Neither does any oneelse yet. He did not understand at all himself—but he remembered thisstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and hefound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out ashe went into the secret garden:""I am going to live forever and ever and ever!""The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and heslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He didnot know that it could be kept. By the next night he had opened thedoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushingback. He left the valley and went on his wandering way again. But,strange as it seemed to him, there were minutes—sometimeshalf-hours—when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed tolift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.Slowly—slowly—for no reason that he knew of—he was ""coming alive""with the garden.As the golden summer changed into the deeper golden autumn he went tothe Lake of Como. There he found the loveliness of a dream. He spent hisdays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into thesoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so thathe might sleep. But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew,and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.""Perhaps,"" he thought, ""my body is growing stronger.""It was growing stronger but—because of the rare peaceful hours when histhoughts were changed—his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. Hebegan to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home. Nowand then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what heshould feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed againand looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it sleptand the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes. Heshrank from it.One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moonwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver. Thestillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not gointo the villa he lived in. He walked down to a little bowered terraceat the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenlyscents of the night. He felt the strange calmness stealing over him andit grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; hisdream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. Heremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thoughthe was. He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the lateroses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard avoice calling. It was sweet and clear and happy and far away. It seemedvery far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his veryside.""Archie! Archie! Archie!"" it said, and then again, sweeter and clearerthan before, ""Archie! Archie!""He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled. It was such a realvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.""Lilias! Lilias!"" he answered. ""Lilias! where are you?""""In the garden,"" it came back like a sound from a golden flute. ""In thegarden!""And then the dream ended. But he did not awaken. He slept soundly andsweetly all through the lovely night. When he did awake at last it wasbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him. He was anItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villawere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign mastermight do. No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where hewould choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in theboat on the lake all night. The man held a salver with some letters onit and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them. When he had goneaway Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and lookingat the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something more—alightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened ashe thought—as if something had changed. He was remembering thedream—the real—real dream.""In the garden!"" he said, wondering at himself. ""In the garden! But thedoor is locked and the key is buried deep.""When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the onelying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came fromYorkshire. It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a handhe knew. He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the firstwords attracted his attention at once.Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.He kept thinking about the dream.""I will go back to Misselthwaite,"" he said. ""Yes, I'll go at once.""And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher toprepare for his return to England.In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroadjourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought inall the ten years past. During those years he had only wished to forgethim. Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of himconstantly drifted into his mind. He remembered the black days when hehad raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother wasdead. He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it atlast it had been such a weak wretched thing that every one had been sureit would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those who took careof it the days passed and it lived and then every one believed it wouldbe a deformed and crippled creature.He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a fatherat all. He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he hadshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in hisown misery. The first time after a year's absence he returned toMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly andindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashesround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he hadadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale asdeath. After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with avicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only be kept fromfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirledhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was ""comingalive"" began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily anddeeply.""Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,"" he said to himself. ""Tenyears is a long time. It may be too late to do anything—quite too late.What have I been thinking of!""Of course this was the wrong Magic—to begin by saying ""too late."" EvenColin could have told him that. But he knew nothing of Magic—eitherblack or white. This he had yet to learn. He wondered if Susan Sowerbyhad taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creaturehad realized that the boy was much worse—was fatally ill. If he had notbeen under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possessionof him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm hadbrought a sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way tothoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe inbetter things.""Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him goodand control him?"" he thought. ""I will go and see her on my way toMisselthwaite.""But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at thecottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in agroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told himthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in themorning to help a woman who had a new baby. ""Our Dickon,"" theyvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens wherehe went several days each week.Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and roundred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and heawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot. He smiled attheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket andgave it to ""our 'Lizabeth Ellen"" who was the oldest.""If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for eachof you,"" he said.Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.Why did it seem to give him a sense of home-coming which he had beensure he could never feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and skyand purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawingnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for sixhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shudderingto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bedwith the brocaded hangings. Was it possible that perhaps he might findhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome hisshrinking from him? How real that dream had been—how wonderful andclear the voice which called back to him, ""In the garden—In thegarden!""""I will try to find the key,"" he said. ""I will try to open the door. Imust—though I don't know why.""When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with theusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go tothe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher. He wentinto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She came to him somewhatexcited and curious and flustered.""How is Master Colin, Medlock?"" he inquired.""Well, sir,"" Mrs. Medlock answered, ""he's—he's different, in a mannerof speaking.""""Worse?"" he suggested.Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.""Well, you see, sir,"" she tried to explain, ""neither Dr. Craven, nor thenurse, nor me can exactly make him out.""""Why is that?""""To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might bechanging for the worse. His appetite, sir, is past understanding—andhis ways—""""Has he become more—more peculiar?"" her master asked, knitting hisbrows anxiously.""That's it, sir. He's growing very peculiar—when you compare him withwhat he used to be. He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began toeat something enormous—and then he stopped again all at once and themeals were sent back just as they used to be. You never knew, sir,perhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. Thethings we've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leavea body trembling like a leaf. He'd throw himself into such a state thatDr. Craven said he couldn't be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir,just without warning—not long after one of his worst tantrums hesuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and SusanSowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair. He took a fancy to bothMiss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, ifyou'll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning untilnight.""""How does he look?"" was the next question.""If he took his food natural, sir, you'd think he was putting onflesh—but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs sometimesin a queer way when he's alone with Miss Mary. He never used to laugh atall. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him. Henever was as puzzled in his life.""""Where is Master Colin now?"" Mr. Craven asked.""In the garden, sir. He's always in the garden—though not a humancreature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him.""Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.""In the garden,"" he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away hestood and repeated it again and again. ""In the garden!""He had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he wasstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and wentout of the room. He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door inthe shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds. The fountainwas playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls. Hedid not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path. He feltas if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken, andhe did not know why. As he drew near to it his step became still moreslow. He knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick overit—but he did not know exactly where it lay—that buried key.So he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the momentafter he had paused he started and listened—asking himself if he werewalking in a dream.The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years—and yetinside the garden there were sounds. They were the sounds of runningscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, theywere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices—exclamations andsmothered joyous cries. It seemed actually like the laughter of youngthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not tobe heard but who in a moment or so—as their excitement mounted—wouldburst forth. What in heaven's name was he dreaming of—what in heaven'sname did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard thingswhich were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice hadmeant?And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the soundsforgot to hush themselves. The feet ran faster and faster—they werenearing the garden door—there was quick strong young breathing and awild outbreak of laughing shouts which could not be contained—and thedoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing theoutsider, dashed almost into his arms.Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as aresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away tolook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.He was a tall boy and a handsome one. He was glowing with life and hisrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face. He threw the thickhair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyesfull of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe. Itwas the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.""Who—What? Who!"" he stammered.This was not what Colin had expected—this was not what he had planned.He had never thought of such a meeting. And yet to come dashingout—winning a race—perhaps it was even better. He drew himself up tohis very tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had dashedthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself looktaller than he had ever looked before—inches taller.""Father,"" he said, ""I'm Colin. You can't believe it. I scarcely canmyself. I'm Colin.""Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when hesaid hurriedly:""In the garden! In the garden!""""Yes,"" hurried on Colin. ""It was the garden that did it—and Mary andDickon and the creatures—and the Magic. No one knows. We kept it totell you when you came. I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race. I'm goingto be an athlete.""He said it all so like a healthy boy—his face flushed, his wordstumbling over each other in his eagerness—that Mr. Craven's soul shookwith unbelieving joy.Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father's arm.""Aren't you glad, Father?"" he ended.""Aren't you glad? I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!""Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him still.He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.""Take me into the garden, my boy,"" he said at last. ""And tell me allabout it.""And so they led him in.The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue andflaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standingtogether—lilies which were white or white and ruby. He remembered wellwhen the first of them had been planted that just at this season of theyear their late glories should reveal themselves. Late roses climbed andhung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowingtrees made one feel that one stood in an embowered temple of gold. Thenewcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came intoits grayness. He looked round and round.""I thought it would be dead,"" he said.""Mary thought so at first,"" said Colin. ""But it came alive.""Then they sat down under their tree—all but Colin, who wanted to standwhile he told the story.It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion. Mystery and Magic andwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting—the coming of thespring—the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajahto his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face. The oddcompanionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept. Thelistener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears cameinto his eyes when he was not laughing. The Athlete, the Lecturer, theScientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young humanthing.""Now,"" he said at the end of the story, ""it need not be a secret anymore. I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they seeme—but I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk backwith you, Father—to the house.""Ben Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but onthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchenand being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink aglass of beer he was on the spot—as he had hoped to be—when the mostdramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the presentgeneration actually took place.One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of thelawn. Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that hemight have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meetingwith Master Colin.""Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?"" she asked.Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back ofhis hand.""Aye, that I did,"" he answered with a shrewdly significant air.""Both of them?"" suggested Mrs. Medlock.""Both of 'em,"" returned Ben Weatherstaff. ""Thank ye kindly, ma'am, Icould sup up another mug of it.""""Together?"" said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in herexcitement.""Together, ma'am,"" and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.""Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to eachother?""""I didna' hear that,"" said Ben, ""along o' only bein' on th' step-ladderlookin' over th' wall. But I'll tell thee this. There's been thingsgoin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about. An' what tha'llfind out tha'll find out soon.""And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer andwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through theshrubbery a piece of the lawn.""Look there,"" he said, ""if tha's curious. Look what's comin' across th'grass.""When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriekand every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across theservants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyesalmost starting out of their heads.Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as manyof them had never seen him. And by his side with his head up in the airand his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boyin Yorkshire—Master Colin!"

They soon know that they will grow up, andthe way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playingin a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. Isuppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her handto her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this forever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, buthenceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two.Two is the beginning of the end.Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Herromantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from thepuzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and hersweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though thereit was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys whenshe was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ranto her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped infirst, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and thekiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, andthen going off in a passion, slamming the door.Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him butrespected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often saidstocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any womanrespect him.Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly,almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout wasmissing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of themthere were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should havebeen totting up. They were Mrs. Darling’s guesses.Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be ableto keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfullyproud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs.Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while shelooked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that wasnot his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if sheconfused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.“Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.“I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I cancut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six,with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught inmy cheque-book makes eight nine seven—who is that moving?—eightnine seven, dot and carry seven—don’t speak, my own—and thepound you lent to that man who came to the door—quiet, child—dotand carry child—there, you’ve done it!—did I say nine nineseven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a yearon nine nine seven?”“Of course we can, George,” she cried. But she was prejudiced inWendy’s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.“Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off hewent again. “Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresayit will be more like thirty shillings—don’t speak—measles onefive, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six—don’twaggle your finger—whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”—andso on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy justgot through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measlestreated as one.There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrowersqueak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of themgoing in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school, accompanied by theirnurse.Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passionfor being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As theywere poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was aprim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particularuntil the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important,however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens,where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was muchhated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complainedof to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. Howthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of hercharges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. Shehad a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with andwhen it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day inold-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over allthis new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety tosee her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side whenthey were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. OnJohn’s footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usuallycarried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in thebasement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait. They sat onforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. Theyaffected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and shedespised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs.Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first whipped offMichael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, andsmoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair.No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darlingknew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.He had his position in the city to consider.Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she didnot admire him. “I know she admires you tremendously, George,” Mrs.Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to bespecially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only otherservant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in herlong skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that shewould never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all wasMrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her wasthe kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There neverwas a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’sminds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children areasleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning,repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered duringthe day. If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would seeyour own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watchher. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, Iexpect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where onearth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedlystowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness andevil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placedat the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread outyour prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can becomeintensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’smind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There arezigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these areprobably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less anisland, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs andrakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomeswho are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes withsix elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old ladywith a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is alsofirst day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting intobraces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, andso on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showingthrough, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will standstill.Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had alagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, whileMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. Johnlived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy ina house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael hadfriends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on thewhole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in arow you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth.On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. Wetoo have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shallland no more.Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, notlarge and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure andanother, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs andtable-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before yougo to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darlingfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexingwas the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in Johnand Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all overwith him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, andas Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.“Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret. Her motherhad been questioning her.“But who is he, my pet?”“He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhoodshe just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. Therewere odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the waywith them, so that they should not be frightened. She had believed in him atthe time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubtedwhether there was any such person.“Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by thistime.”“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently,“and he is just my size.” She meant that he was her size in bothmind and body; she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark mywords,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting intotheir heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and itwill blow over.”But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quitea shock.Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. Forinstance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, thatwhen they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game withhim. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquietingrevelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, whichcertainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling waspuzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:“I do believe it is that Peter again!”“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said,sighing. She was a tidy child.She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimescame to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played onhis pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn’t know howshe knew, she just knew.“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house withoutknocking.”“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.“My love, it is three floors up.”“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendythat you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me ofthis before?”“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get herbreakfast.Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them verycarefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come fromany tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering at it witha candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney andtapped the walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and itwas a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night onwhich the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened tobe Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to themtill one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep.All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat downtranquilly by the fire to sew.It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. Thefire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, andpresently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then her head nodded, oh,so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael overthere, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourthnight-light.While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come toonear and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her,for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have nochildren. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But inher dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendyand John and Michael peeping through the gap.The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming thewindow of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He wasaccompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted aboutthe room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light thatwakened Mrs. Darling.She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once thathe was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen thathe was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad inskeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancingthing about him was that he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was agrown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her."

She growled and sprang at the boy,who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time indistress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into thestreet to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up,and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was ashooting star.She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, whichproved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closedit quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out;slam went the window and snapped it off.You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quitethe ordinary kind.Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hungit out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let us putit where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, itlooked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thoughtof showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for Johnand Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and itseemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:“It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.”She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, untila fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Ofcourse it was a Friday.“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used tosay afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her,holding her hand.“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for itall. I, George Darling, did it. Mea culpa, mea culpa.” He had hada classical education.They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detailof it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like thefaces on a bad coinage.“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs.Darling said.“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” saidMr. Darling.“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was whatNana’s wet eyes said.“My liking for parties, George.”“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought,“It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for anurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief toNana’s eyes.“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was theecho of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in theright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallestdetail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so preciselylike a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water forMichael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who stillbelieved that he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, Iwon’t. Nana, it isn’t six o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, Ishan’t love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won’t be bathed, Iwon’t, I won’t!”Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressedearly because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklaceGeorge had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet on her arm; shehad asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on theoccasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now amother,” in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on thereal occasion.Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of amale, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John saidbrutally that they did not want any more.Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of coursethe lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.“Boy.”Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darlingand Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael’slast night in the nursery.They go on with their recollections.“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr.Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for theparty, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is anastounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks andshares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to himwithout a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better forthe house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpledlittle brute of a tie in his hand.“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will nottie.” He became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Roundthe bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, butround my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly,“I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck wedon’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinnerto-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the officeagain, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into thestreets.”Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said,and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice coolhands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see theirfate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily,but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly,at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room withMichael on his back.“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How didyou get to know me, mother?’”“I remember!”“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darlingcollided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only newtrousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and hehad had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darlingbrushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dogfor a nurse.“George, Nana is a treasure.”“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon thechildren as puppies.”“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.”It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At firsthe pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him theshadow.“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “butit does look a scoundrel.”“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling,“when Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carrythe bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved ratherfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that allhis life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged thespoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man,Michael.”“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darlingleft the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showedwant of firmness.“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her.“Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said,‘Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make mewell.’”He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown,believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That medicine yousometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and Iwould take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost thebottle.”He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top ofthe wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithfulLiza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be ofservice. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he couldstop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff.It’s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.”“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then inrushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with avindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michaelfirst,” he said doggedly.“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.“Come on, father,” said John.“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily,father.”“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, thatthere is more in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heartwas nearly bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though itwere with my last breath; it isn’t fair.”“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”“Father’s a cowardly custard.”“So are you a cowardly custard.”“I’m not frightened.”“Neither am I frightened.”“Well, then, take it.”“Well, then, you take it.”Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready,Michael?”Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr.Darling slipped his behind his back.There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendyexclaimed.“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded.“Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missedit.”It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they didnot admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly, assoon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of asplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she willdrink it, thinking it is milk!”It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’ssense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicineinto Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and theydid not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a littlemilk into your bowl, Nana.”Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gaveMr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tearthat makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In ahorrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she said,“it’s your medicine!”“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, andWendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearingmyself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.”And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted.“Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,why should I be coddled—why, why, why!”“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; theservants will hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of callingLiza the servants.“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the wholeworld. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hourlonger.”The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. Hefelt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied upthis instant.”“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what Itold you about that boy.”Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in thathouse, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her outof it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from thenursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to histoo affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her upin the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with hisknuckles to his eyes.In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silenceand lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered,“It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but Wendy waswiser.“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessingwhat was about to happen; “that is her bark when she smellsdanger.”Danger!“Are you sure, Wendy?”“Oh, yes.”Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. Shelooked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round thehouse, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did notnotice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet anameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, “Oh, how I wishthat I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked,“Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a motherleaves behind her to guard her children.”She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michaelflung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m gladof you.” They were the last words she was to hear from him for a longtime.No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow,and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil theirshoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars werewatching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part inanything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them forsomething they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the olderones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language),but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, whohad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious toget the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr.and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest ofall the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:“Now, Peter!”"
Peter Pan,"""Peter and Wendy"" by J.M. Barrie is a classic children's novel first published in the early 20th century. The story revolves around the beloved character Peter Pan and follows his adventures in the fantastical Neverland, along with a young girl named Wendy Darling and her brothers, John and Michael. The themes of childhood, innocence, and the challenges of growing up are prevalent throughout the narrative. At the start of the story, we...  Read Moreare introduced to the Darling family and their idyllic life in London. Wendy, the eldest child, grapples with the idea of growing up while her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Darling, navigate the challenges of parenthood. As the narrative unfolds, Peter Pan breaks into their nursery, and the children's imaginations ignite as they prepare for an adventure in Neverland. Wendy, along with her brothers, is enchanted by Peter's promise of flying and the magical world that awaits them. The opening sets the stage for a tale filled with whimsical characters, such as Tinker Bell, and introduces dark undertones through the presence of Captain Hook, foreshadowing the conflicts and trials that will unfold in their journey. ",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,"COME AWAY, COME AWAY!","For a moment after Mr. and Mrs. Darling left the house the night-lights by thebeds of the three children continued to burn clearly. They were awfully nicelittle night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have keptawake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave such a yawn thatthe other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all thethree went out.There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than thenight-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all thedrawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged the wardrobeand turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made thislight by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second yousaw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girlcalled Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square,through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightlyinclined to embonpoint.A moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by thebreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried Tinker Bellpart of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust.“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that thechildren were asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug forthe moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put myshadow?”The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language.You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you wouldknow that you had heard it once before.Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers,and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor withboth hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a moment he hadrecovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bellup in the drawer.If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that heand his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water,and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap fromthe bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he saton the floor and cried.His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see astranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.“Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairyceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much pleased, andbowed beautifully to him from the bed.“What’s your name?” he asked.“Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction.“What is your name?”“Peter Pan.”She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparativelyshort name.“Is that all?”“Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that itwas a shortish name.“I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.“It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.She asked where he lived.“Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on tillmorning.”“What a funny address!”Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funnyaddress.“No, it isn’t,” he said.“I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess,“is that what they put on the letters?”He wished she had not mentioned letters.“Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.“But your mother gets letters?”“Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother,but he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them veryover-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presenceof a tragedy.“O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bedand ran to him.“I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly.“I was crying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, Iwasn’t crying.”“It has come off?”“Yes.”Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she wasfrightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she couldnot help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap.How exactly like a boy!Fortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” shesaid, just a little patronisingly.“What’s sewn?” he asked.“You’re dreadfully ignorant.”“No, I’m not.”But she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, mylittle man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out herhousewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.“I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.“Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of theopinion that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and didnot cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a littlecreased.“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, butPeter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about inthe wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss toWendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How clever Iam!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of hismost fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was acockier boy.But for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit,” she exclaimed,with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”“You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.“A little!” she replied with hauteur; “if I am no use I canat least withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed andcovered her face with the blankets.To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed hesat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.“Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t helpcrowing, Wendy, when I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would notlook up, though she was listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued,in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, onegirl is more use than twenty boys.”Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, andshe peeped out of the bed-clothes.“Do you really think so, Peter?”“Yes, I do.”“I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared,“and I’ll get up again,” and she sat with him on the side ofthe bed. She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did notknow what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.“Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.“I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and notto hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.“Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and shereplied with a slight primness, “If you please.” She made herselfrather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acornbutton into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had beenbefore, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around herneck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards tosave her life.When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask eachother’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing,asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; itwas like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be askedis Kings of England.“I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quiteyoung.” He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but hesaid at a venture, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charmingdrawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearerher.“It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a lowvoice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He wasextraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be aman,” he said with passion. “I want always to be a little boy andto have fun. So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long timeamong the fairies.”She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it wasbecause he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies. Wendy hadlived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. Shepoured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather anuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had togive them a hiding. Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her aboutthe beginning of fairies.“You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, itslaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and thatwas the beginning of fairies.”Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.“And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be onefairy for every boy and girl.”“Ought to be? Isn’t there?”“No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believein fairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe infairies,’ there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck himthat Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think where shehas gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy’sheart went flutter with a sudden thrill.“Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean totell me that there is a fairy in this room!”“She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “Youdon’t hear her, do you?” and they both listened.“The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle ofbells.”“Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hearher too.”The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face. No onecould ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was hislaugh. He had his first laugh still.“Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her upin the drawer!”He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery screamingwith fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.“Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in thedrawer?”Wendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if shewould only stand still and let me see her!”“They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendysaw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O thelovely!” she cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted withpassion.“Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes youwere her fairy.”Tinker Bell answered insolently.“What does she say, Peter?”He had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a greatugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”He tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”To this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” anddisappeared into the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peterexplained apologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mendsthe pots and kettles.”They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with morequestions.“If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now—”“Sometimes I do still.”“But where do you live mostly now?”“With the lost boys.”“Who are they?”“They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurseis looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sentfar away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I’m captain.”“What fun it must be!”“Yes,” said cunning Peter, “but we are rather lonely. You seewe have no female companionship.”“Are none of the others girls?”“Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of theirprams.”This flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it isperfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despisesus.”For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick.This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him withspirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleepso placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there. “And Iknow you meant to be kind,” she said, relenting, “so you may giveme a kiss.”For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thoughtyou would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to returnher the thimble.“Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, Imean a thimble.”“What’s that?”“It’s like this.” She kissed him.“Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you athimble?”“If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,Wendy?”“It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”“That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.“She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you athimble.”“But why?”“Why, Tink?”Again Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understandwhy, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when headmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen tostories.“You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows anystories.”“How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.“Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eavesof houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling yousuch a lovely story.”“Which story was it?”“About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glassslipper.”“Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and hefound her, and they lived happily ever after.”Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, andhurried to the window.“Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.“To tell the other boys.”“Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots ofstories.”Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she whofirst tempted him.He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to havealarmed her, but did not.“Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and thenPeter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.“Let me go!” she ordered him.“Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, Ican’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”“I’ll teach you.”“Oh, how lovely to fly.”“I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then awaywe go.”“Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.“Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might beflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”“Oo!”“And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”“Mermaids! With tails?”“Such long tails.”“Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”He had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how weshould all respect you.”She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying toremain on the nursery floor.But he had no pity for her.“Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in atnight.”“Oo!”“None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”“Oo,” and her arms went out to him.“And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us hasany pockets.”How could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!”she cried. “Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”“If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John andMichael and shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan hascome and he is to teach us to fly.”John rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course hewas on the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six bladesand a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awfulcraftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was asstill as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana,who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was hersilence they had heard.“Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command forthe only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you wouldhave sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as theyslept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in thekitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, byNana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a littlequiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was indisgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of thelittle angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they werenearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to dragherself out of Liza’s clutches.But Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly,pulling her out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall gostraight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then,oh, won’t master whip you, just.”She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bringmaster and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she wanted. Doyou think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe?Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no helpwould come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she brokeit. In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up herpaws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs.Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind thecurtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.We now return to the nursery.“It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from hishiding-place. “I say, Peter, can you really fly?”Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking themantelpiece on the way.“How topping!” said John and Michael.“How sweet!” cried Wendy.“Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting hismanners again.It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and thenfrom the beds, but they always went down instead of up.“I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He wasquite a practical boy.“You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained,“and they lift you up in the air.”He showed them again.“You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t youdo it very slowly once?”Peter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now,Wendy!” cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them couldfly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter didnot know A from Z.Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless thefairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of hishands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superbresults.“Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and letgo.”They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quitemean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.“I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.“Oh, lovely!”“Oh, ripping!”“Look at me!”“Look at me!”“Look at me!”They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little,but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothingso delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tinkwas so indignant.Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.“I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all goout?”Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles.But Wendy hesitated.“Mermaids!” said Peter again.“Oo!”“And there are pirates.”“Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go atonce.”It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window;and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and mostheart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain threelittle figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor butin the air.Not three figures, four!In a tremble they opened the street door.

Peter, you see, just said anything that came into hishead.At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delightsof flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tallobjects on the way that took their fancy.John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselvesfine fellows for being able to fly round a room.Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before thisthought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second seaand their third night.Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold andagain too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merelypretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way wasto pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch itfrom them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would allgo chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressionsof good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem toknow that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor eventhat there are other ways.Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was adanger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing wasthat Peter thought this funny.“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenlydropped like a stone.“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruelsea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michaeljust before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; buthe always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness thatinterested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety,and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him,so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would letyou go.He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back andfloating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if yougot behind him and blew he went faster.“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they wereplaying “Follow my Leader.”“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and toucheach shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run yourfinger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with muchsuccess, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he keptlooking behind to see how many tails they missed.“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers.“What could we do if he were to leave us!”“We could go back,” Michael said.“How could we ever find our way back without him?”“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for wedon’t know how to stop.”This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to gostraight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back totheir own window.“And who is to get food for us, John?”“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly,Wendy.”“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And eventhough we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds andthings if he is not near to give us a hand.”Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though theystill kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the morethey tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana hadbeen with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael’s forehead bythis time.Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there bythemselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shootout of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would comedown laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, buthe had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scalesstill sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had beenhappening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen amermaid.“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how canwe expect that he will go on remembering us?”Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well.Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about topass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.He was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her,“always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll remember.”Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showedthem how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and thiswas such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that theycould sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Petertired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice,“We get off here.” So with occasional tiffs, but on the wholerollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reachit, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, notperhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the islandwas looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magicshores.“There it is,” said Peter calmly.“Where, where?”“Where all the arrows are pointing.”Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, alldirected by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their waybefore leaving them for the night.Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sightof the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fearfell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen atlast, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for theholidays.“John, there’s the lagoon.”“Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”“I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”“Look, Michael, there’s your cave!”“John, what’s that in the brushwood?”“It’s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that’s yourlittle whelp!”“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of theredskin camp!”“Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whetherthey are on the war-path.”“There, just across the Mysterious River.”“I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted tolord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anonfear fell upon them?It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little darkand threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread,black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quitedifferent now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. Youwere quite glad that the night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say thatthis was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was allmake-believe.Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was realnow, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment,and where was Nana?They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His carelessmanner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went throughthem every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island,flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid wasvisible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly asif they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung inthe air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder,but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand tohis ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed tobore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.His courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventurenow,” he said casually to John, “or would you like to have your teafirst?”Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand ingratitude, but the braver John hesitated.“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,”Peter told him. “If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.“I do.”“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wakeup.”Peter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while hewas sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way Ialways do.”“I say! Do you kill many?”“Tons.”John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked ifthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had neverknown so many.“Who is captain now?”“Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he saidthat hated word.“Jas. Hook?”“Ay.”Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, forthey knew Hook’s reputation.“He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily.“He is the worst of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue wasafraid.”“That’s him,” said Peter.“What is he like? Is he big?”“He is not so big as he was.”“How do you mean?”“I cut off a bit of him.”“You!”“Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.“I wasn’t meaning to be disrespectful.”“Oh, all right.”“But, I say, what bit?”“His right hand.”“Then he can’t fight now?”“Oh, can’t he just!”“Left-hander?”“He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws withit.”“Claws!”“I say, John,” said Peter.“Yes.”“Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”“Ay, ay, sir.”“There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy whoserves under me has to promise, and so must you.”John paled.“It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him tome.”“I promise,” John said loyally.For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them,and in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could notfly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle inwhich they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed outthe drawbacks.“She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us beforethe darkness came, and got Long Tom out.”“The big gun?”“Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we arenear it they are sure to let fly.”“Wendy!”“John!”“Michael!”“Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three criedsimultaneously, but he refused.“She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “andshe is rather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all byherself when she is frightened!”For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a lovinglittle pinch.“Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”“She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairiescan’t do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as thestars.”“Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.“She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the onlyother thing fairies can’t do.”“Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two thingsworth doing.”Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.“If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carryher in it.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was nota pocket between the four of them.He had a happy idea. John’s hat!Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it,though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat,because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shallsee, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on insilence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by adistant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at theford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of treesrubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “Ifonly something would make a sound!” he cried.As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crashhe had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to crysavagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island ofmake-believe and the same island come true.When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselvesalone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michaelwithout knowing how to float was floating.“Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.“I haven’t tried yet,” Michael whispered back.We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by thewind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards with nocompanion but Tinker Bell.It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat.I don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she hadplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lureWendy to her destruction.Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the otherhand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other,because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at atime. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change.At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovelytinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was badwords, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning“Follow me, and all will be well.”What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael, andgot only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink hated her withthe fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered, and now staggering inher flight, she followed Tink to her doom."

The fairies take an hourlonger in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feedheavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet theymerely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hateslethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, youwould hear the whole island seething with life.On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. Thelost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lostboys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were outlooking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but theydid not meet because all were going at the same rate.All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were outto greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers,according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up,which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there weresix of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among thesugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his handon his dagger.They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear theskins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furrythat when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed.The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate ofall that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them,because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round thecorner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off togather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would besweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to hiscountenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he wasquite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the airfor you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, ifaccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is benton mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks you are the mosteasily tricked of the boys. ’Ware Tinker Bell.Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passesby, biting his knuckles.Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistlesout of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the mostconceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, withtheir manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curlyis fourth; he is a pickle, and so often has he had to deliver up his personwhen Peter said sternly, “Stand forth the one who did this thing,”that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it ornot. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure tobe describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and hisband were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two werealways vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction bykeeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, forthings go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear thembefore they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:“Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,A-pirating we go,And if we’re parted by a shotWe’re sure to meet below!”A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, alittle in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, hisgreat arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsomeItalian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governorof the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names sincehe dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on thebanks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, thesame Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the Walrus from Flint before hewould drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’sbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in apublic school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights(Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly genialman who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformistin Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; andRobt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared onthe Spanish Main.In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclinedJames Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was theonly man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawnand propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook withwhich ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs thisterrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In personhe was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularlythreatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blueof the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunginghis hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them uphorribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, sothat he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was araconteur of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was mostpolite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of hisdiction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of hisdemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man ofindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sightof his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress hesomewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heardit said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblanceto the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his owncontrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly thegrimmest part of him was his iron claw.Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. Asthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar;the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the bodyis kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars fromhis mouth.Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win?On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which isnot visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them withhis eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleamwith paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as ofpirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with thesofter-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great BigLittle Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position theysomewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatestdanger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She isthe most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,coquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would not havethe wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observehow they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The onlysound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they areall a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will workthis off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place istaken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, andthe innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind ofbeast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on thefavoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. Weshall see for whom she is looking presently.The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession mustcontinue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Thenquickly they will be on top of each other.All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the dangermay be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was.The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselvesdown on the sward, close to their underground home.“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them saidnervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger thantheir captain.“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightlysaid, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhapssome distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish hewould come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more aboutCinderella.”They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must havebeen very like her.It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, thesubject being forbidden by him as silly.“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is thatshe often said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of myown!’ I don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love togive my mother one.”While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild thingsof the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grimsong:“Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,The flag o’ skull and bones,A merry hour, a hempen rope,And hey for Davy Jones.”At once the lost boys—but where are they? They are no longer there.Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted awayto reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a verydelightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how havethey reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a largestone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely,however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with ahole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances tothe home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these manymoons. Will he find it tonight?As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearingthrough the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw grippedhis shoulder.“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins uponus. Do you want to lose your scalp?”“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “andtickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names foreverything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in thewound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, afterkilling, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and Iwant to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smeewere alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it wasbecause of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire toconfide to his faithful bo’sun the story of his life. He spoke long andearnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not knowin the least.Anon he caught the word Peter.“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want theircaptain, Peter Pan. ’Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished thehook threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this.Oh, I’ll tear him!”“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hookwas worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would prayto have my children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a lookof pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again hefrowned.“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile thathappened to be passing by.”“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread ofcrocodiles.”“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that onecrocodile.” He lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee,that it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land,licking its lips for the rest of me.”“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of acompliment.”“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I wantPeter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice.“Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had mebefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tickinside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.” Helaughed, but in a hollow way.“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and thenhe’ll get you.”Hook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s thefear that haunts me.”Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said,“this seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer andtongs I’m burning.”They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on themainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands,for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirateslooked at each other. “A chimney!” they both exclaimed.They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was thecustom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in theneighbourhood.Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for sosafe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked aroundthem and noted the holes in the seven trees.“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smeewhispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdlingsmile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. “Unrip yourplan, captain,” he cried eagerly.“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth,“and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moleshad not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows theyhave no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids’Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids.They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother,they don’t know how dangerous ’tis to eat rich damp cake.” Heburst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha,they will die.”Smee had listened with growing admiration.“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” hecried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:“Avast, belay, when I appear,By fear they’re overtook;Nought’s left upon your bones when youHave shaken claws with Hook.”They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke inand stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might havefallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.Tick tick tick tick!Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by hisbo’sun.It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on thetrail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were notyet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by apack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying ofthem was horrible.“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.“But what can we do, what can we do?”It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughtsturned to him.“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.Almost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them throughhis legs.”And then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bentand looked through their legs. The next moment is the long one, but victorycame quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, thewolves dropped their tails and fled.Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring eyesstill saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gatheredround him eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”“What kind of a bird, do you think?”“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks soweary, and as it flies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”“Poor Wendy?”“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birdscalled Wendies.”“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry. But moredistinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous fairy had now castoff all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her victim from everydirection, pinching savagely each time she touched.“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.Tink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us dowhat Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows andarrows!”All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with him, andTink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be sopleased.”Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way,Tink,” he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the groundwith an arrow in her breast."

They had crowded round Wendy, and as they looked aterrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been beatingthey would all have heard it.Slightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in ascared voice. “I think this must be a lady.”“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.“And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.They all whipped off their caps.“Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her tous.” He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.“A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins,“and you have killed her!”They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a stepnearer them they turned from him.Tootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now thathad never been there before.“I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come tome in dreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when atlast she really came, I shot her.”He moved slowly away.“Don’t go,” they called in pity.“I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid ofPeter.”It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart ofevery one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.“Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled hisreturn.“Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. ButTootles stood aloof.Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.“Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, andthen again was silence.He frowned.“I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked it inhis haste to tell the glorious tidings.“Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last amother for you all.”Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees.“Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “Sheflew this way.”“Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournfulday.”Tootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her toyou,” and when the others would still have hidden her he said,“Back, twins, let Peter see.”So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a littletime he did not know what to do next.“She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she isfrightened at being dead.”He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight ofher, and then never going near the spot any more. They would all have been gladto follow if he had done this.But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.“Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.“Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.“Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use itas a dagger.Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” hesaid firmly, “strike true.”Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannotstrike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays myhand.”All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.“It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”Wonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and listenedreverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” hewhispered.“She lives,” Peter said briefly.Slightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had put iton a chain that she wore round her neck.“See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is thekiss I gave her. It has saved her life.”“I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me seeit. Ay, that’s a kiss.”Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so that hecould show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet, being still ina frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.“Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because theWendy lives.”Then they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had theyseen him look so stern.“Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more.Begone from me for ever.”She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not untilWendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, “Well, notfor ever, but for a whole week.”Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh dear no,never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, whounderstood them best, often cuffed them.But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?“Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does withladies.”“No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would notbe sufficiently respectful.”“That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”“But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”“Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no wayout.”“Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little houseround her.”They were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring meeach of you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding. Theyskurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while theywere at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they dragged along theground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step andslept again.“John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana,John, and mother?”And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we didfly.”You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.“Hullo, Peter,” they said.“Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgottenthem. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see howlarge a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and atable. John and Michael watched him.“Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.“Yes.”“John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her tomake supper for us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed oncarrying branches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” hecried.“Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see thatthese boys help in the building of the house.”“Ay, ay, sir.”“Build a house?” exclaimed John.“For the Wendy,” said Curly.“For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only agirl!”“That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”“You? Wendy’s servants!”“Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.“Chairs and a fender first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shallbuild a house round them.”“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it allcomes back to me.”Peter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch adoctor.”“Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching hishead. But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearingJohn’s hat and looking solemn.“Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you adoctor?”The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knewit was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the samething. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that theyhad had their dinners.If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.“Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chappedknuckles.“Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.“Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”“In yonder glade.”“I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and hemade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when theglass thing was withdrawn.“How is she?” inquired Peter.“Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”“I am glad!” Peter cried.“I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give herbeef tea out of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned thehat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from adifficulty.In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almosteverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.“If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likesbest.”“Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”“Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it.“Oh, lovely!”“Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter.“Wendy, sing the kind of house you would like to have.”Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:“I wish I had a pretty house,The littlest ever seen,With funny little red wallsAnd roof of mossy green.”They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches theyhad brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted withmoss. As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves:“We’ve built the little walls and roofAnd made a lovely door,So tell us, mother Wendy,What are you wanting more?”To this she answered greedily:“Oh, really next I think I’ll haveGay windows all about,With roses peeping in, you know,And babies peeping out.”With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were theblinds. But roses—?“Roses,” cried Peter sternly.Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.Babies?To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:“We’ve made the roses peeping out,The babes are at the door,We cannot make ourselves, you know,’Cos we’ve been made before.”Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own.The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though,of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode up and down, orderingfinishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemedabsolutely finished:“There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it made anexcellent knocker.Absolutely finished now, they thought.Not of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “wemust have a chimney.”“It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. Thisgave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out thebottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to havesuch a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began tocome out of the hat.Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock.“All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressionsare awfully important.”He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all too busylooking their best.He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a soundto be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openlysneering.What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a lady,what would she be like?The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off theirhats.She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she wouldlook.“Where am I?” she said.Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,”he said rapidly, “for you we built this house.”“Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very wordsthey had hoped she would say.“And we are your children,” cried the twins.Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O Wendylady, be our mother.”“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’sfrightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no realexperience.”“That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the onlyperson present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knewleast. “What we need is just a nice motherly person.”“Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly whatI am.”“It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”“Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside atonce, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put youto bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”In they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you cansqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyousevenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed inthe home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house,and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heardcarousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked socosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds,and the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a timehe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their wayhome from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at nightthey would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter’s nose and passedon."

",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John andMichael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys forthinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless yourtree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys werequite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, anddown you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and letout alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered theaction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothingcan be more graceful.But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully asfor a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made tofit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. Usually it is done quiteeasily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpyin awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does somethings to you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be takento go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps awhole family in perfect condition.Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to bealtered a little.After a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as bucketsin a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground;especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, witha floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floorgrew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Nevertree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawedthe trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about twofeet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming atable; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thusthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was inalmost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendystretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bedwas tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearlyhalf the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying likesardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gavethe signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, butWendy would have a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are,and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of anunderground house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in thewall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of TinkerBell. It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, whichTink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir andbed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine QueenMab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to whatfruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there arenow only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crustand reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and thecarpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was achandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she litthe residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, asindeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked ratherconceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagiousboys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, exceptperhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. Thecooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there wasnothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it cameaboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real mealor just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat,really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feelstodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the nextbest thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that duringa meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying, butyou simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you weregetting loose for your tree he let you stodge.Wendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all goneto bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; andshe occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on theknees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole init, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am sure Isometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she hadcome to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into eachother’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had leftbehind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to sayhow time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons andsuns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I amafraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she wasabsolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to flyback by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at timeswas that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known,while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she triedto fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, aslike as possible to the ones she used to do at school. The other boys thoughtthis awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates forthemselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about thequestions she had written on another slate and passed round. They were the mostordinary questions—“What was the colour of Mother’s eyes?Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer allthree questions if possible.” “(A) Write an essay of not less than40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father andMother compared. Only one of these to be attempted.” Or “(1)Describe Mother’s laugh; (2) Describe Father’s laugh; (3) DescribeMother’s Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.”They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answerthem you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number ofcrosses even John made. Of course the only boy who replied to every questionwas Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, buthis answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: amelancholy thing.Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, andfor another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write norspell; not the smallest word. He was above all that sort of thing.By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was thecolour of Mother’s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been forgetting,too.Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but aboutthis time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that fascinatedhim enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as youhave been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted inpretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michaelhad been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air,pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killedso much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight;he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him sucha comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of hishealth. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him;and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he wouldhave treated them severely.He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutelycertain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it socompletely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you foundthe body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yetyou could not find the body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, andthen Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told adazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however,many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, andthere were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys werein them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require abook as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most wecan do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. Thedifficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskinsat Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting asshowing one of Peter’s peculiarities, which was that in the middle of afight he would suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still inthe balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,“I’m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?” And Tootlesanswered, “Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and Nibs said,“Redskin; what are you Twin?” and so on; and they were allredskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the realredskins fascinated by Peter’s methods, agreed to be lost boys for thatonce, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was—but we have not decidedyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would bethe night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several ofthem stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we mighttell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s life in the Mermaids’ Lagoon, andso made her his ally.Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat itand perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; butalways Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time itlost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile,and Hook fell over it in the dark.Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularlyof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nestfell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave ordersthat she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows howgrateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventureof the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than justone. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’sattempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendyconveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gaveway and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, wemight choose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle roundhim on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though hewaited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly fromtrees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss for it.I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that thegulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it again,and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon."

But just before they go on fireyou see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland,just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surfand hear the mermaids singing.The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floatingmost of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. Youmust not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: onthe contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting regrets that all the time shewas on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stolesoftly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially onMarooners’ Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in alazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as itwere, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probablysplashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chattedwith them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails whenthey got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, whenthey utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then,and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen thelagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompaniedher, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when themermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. Thebubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting themgaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in therainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and thekeepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these gameswill be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves,for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that theysecretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them;for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead ofthe hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has lefton the Neverland.It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock forhalf an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, andit had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they laythere in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside themand looked important.It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock wasnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not totake up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyesshut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. Shewas very busy, stitching.While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, andthe sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendycould no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoonthat had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable andunfriendly.It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night hadcome. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver throughthe sea to say that it was coming. What was it?There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there todrown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because ofthe unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer goodfor them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and shedid not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half anhour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed tohear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound ofmuffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. Shestood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniffdanger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog,and with one warning cry he roused the others.He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smilewas playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smilewas on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand readyto obey. The order came sharp and incisive.“Dive!”There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itselfmarooned.The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smeeand Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands andankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left onthe rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fireor torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is nopath through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; shewas the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it isenough.They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. Nowatch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of hisname guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to guard italso. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rocktill they crashed into it.“Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s;“here’s the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist theredskin on to it and leave her here to drown.”It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock;she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down,Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedyshe had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. Hewas less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angeredhim, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until thepirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice ofHook.“Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellousimitation.“The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.“He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had lookedfor him in vain.“We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.“Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.“Free!”“Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”“But, captain—”“At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’llplunge my hook in you.”“This is queer!” Smee gasped.“Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.“Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At oncelike an eel she slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knewthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, soat once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was stayed even in theact, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s voice,and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle ofsurprise instead.“Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he hadsoon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip theboat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from thewater, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would notbudge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. “Am Inot a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he whispered to her, and though shethought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no oneheard him except herself.He signed to her to listen.The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain tothem, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profoundmelancholy.“Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with ahollow moan.“He sighs,” said Smee.“He sighs again,” said Starkey.“And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.Then at last he spoke passionately.“The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found amother.”Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.“O evil day!” cried Starkey.“What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!”and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee wouldbe her one.Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,“What was that?”“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over thewaters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest Ihave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.“See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that isa mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but wouldthe mother desert her eggs? No.”There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent dayswhen—but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but themore suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is hangingabout here to help Peter.”Hook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that hauntsme.”He was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.“Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’mother and make her our mother?”“It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it tookpractical shape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carrythem to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be ourmother.”Again Wendy forgot herself.“Never!” she cried, and bobbed.“What was that?”But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind.“Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.“There is my hand on it,” they both said.“And there is my hook. Swear.”They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hookremembered Tiger Lily.“Where is the redskin?” he demanded abruptly.He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of themoments.“That is all right, captain,” Smee answered complacently; “welet her go.”“Let her go!” cried Hook.“’Twas your own orders,” the bo’sun faltered.“You called over the water to us to let her go,” said Starkey.“Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening is goingon here!” His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that theybelieved their words, and he was startled. “Lads,” he said, shakinga little, “I gave no such order.”“It is passing queer,” Smee said, and they all fidgeteduncomfortably. Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.“Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried,“dost hear me?”Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. Heimmediately answered in Hook’s voice:“Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee andStarkey clung to each other in terror.“Who are you, stranger? Speak!” Hook demanded.“I am James Hook,” replied the voice, “captain of theJolly Roger.”“You are not; you are not,” Hook cried hoarsely.“Brimstone and gall,” the voice retorted, “say that again,and I’ll cast anchor in you.”Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. “If you are Hook,” he saidalmost humbly, “come tell me, who am I?”“A codfish,” replied the voice, “only a codfish.”“A codfish!” Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not tillthen, that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.“Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!” they muttered.“It is lowering to our pride.”They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had become, hescarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief inhim that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego slipping from him.“Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to it.In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the greatpirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried the guessinggame.“Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own voice,“I have.”“And another name?”“Ay, ay.”“Vegetable?” asked Hook.“No.”“Mineral?”“No.”“Animal?”“Yes.”“Man?”“No!” This answer rang out scornfully.“Boy?”“Yes.”“Ordinary boy?”“No!”“Wonderful boy?”To Wendy’s pain the answer that rang out this time was “Yes.”“Are you in England?”“No.”“Are you here?”“Yes.”Hook was completely puzzled. “You ask him some questions,” he saidto the others, wiping his damp brow.Smee reflected. “I can’t think of a thing,” he saidregretfully.“Can’t guess, can’t guess!” crowed Peter. “Do yougive it up?”Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the miscreantssaw their chance.“Yes, yes,” they answered eagerly.“Well, then,” he cried, “I am Peter Pan.”Pan!In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his faithfulhenchmen.“Now we have him,” Hook shouted. “Into the water, Smee.Starkey, mind the boat. Take him dead or alive!”He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.“Are you ready, boys?”“Ay, ay,” from various parts of the lagoon.“Then lam into the pirates.”The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who gallantlyclimbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce struggle, in which thecutlass was torn from the pirate’s grasp. He wriggled overboard and Johnleapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steelfollowed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at their own side.The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinkedin turn by Curly. Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and thetwins hard.Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing fromthe pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, fromwhich they fled like affrighted fishes.But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter thatcircle.Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock tobreathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rockwas slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knewthat the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip met the other’s arm:in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so theymet.Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to theyhad a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. Afterall, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had nosinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teethwith joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and wasabout to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than hisfoe. It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to helphim up.It was then that Hook bit him.Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made him quitehelpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus thefirst time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he has a right to when hecomes to you to be yours is fairness. After you have been unfair to him he willlove you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one evergets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but healways forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and allthe rest.So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just stare,helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildlyfor the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for thecrocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys wouldhave swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost bothPeter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name.They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy”as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.“They must be swimming back or flying,” the boys concluded. Theywere not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled,boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all motherWendy’s fault!When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then afeeble cry.“Help, help!”Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and layon the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock andthen lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water wasrising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more.As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pullingher softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start,and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to tell her the truth.“We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growingsmaller. Soon the water will be over it.”She did not understand even now.“We must go,” she said, almost brightly.“Yes,” he answered faintly.“Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”He had to tell her.“Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, withoutmy help?”She had to admit that she was too tired.He moaned.“What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.“I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly norswim.”“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”“Look how the water is rising.”They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought theywould soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against Peter aslight as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, “Can I be of anyuse?”It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It had tornitself out of his hand and floated away.“Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but nextmoment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.“It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should itnot carry you?”“Both of us!”“It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”“Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.“And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her.She clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,Wendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borneout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of lighttiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at oncethe most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling tothe moon.Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ranthrough him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudderfollows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one.Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on hisface and a drum beating within him. It was saying, “To die will be anawfully big adventure.”"

He was too far away to heartheir doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings atiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on themainland), and he heard the bells.Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass thetime until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, andwondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon thelagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimeswinning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, couldnot help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperateefforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a way she hadlearned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent toguide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was veryexhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there wereeggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, hehad also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darlingand the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what shewas doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other’slanguage. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wishfor the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peterreplied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tellyou only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand eachother, but they forgot their manners.“I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,”the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,“and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—tryto—swim—to—it.”“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Whydon’t you let the nest drift as usual?”“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it allover.Then Peter tried slow and distinct.“What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.“You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’tyou do as I tell you?”Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly:“So are you!”Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:“Shut up!”“Shut up!”Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one lastmighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up she flew;deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to thebird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, thatshe hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; itwas to see what he did with her eggs.There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. Thebird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; butshe could not help peeping between the feathers.I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driveninto it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. Thechildren had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous moodused to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to thegulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvytrick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on itStarkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floatedbeautifully.The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration ofhim; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest,reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the samemoment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on hereggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, bothcheering.Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the birdwould easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandonedthe nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came tothe shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sittingon his hat. As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here thatall Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which theyoungsters take an airing.Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almostas soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Everyboy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was thatthey were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they didvarious dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demandingbandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe andsound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed,to bed,” in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she wasawfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played tillbed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings."

Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now therewas nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above,keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by thepirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hungabout, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bitsto eat.They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before him;and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him.“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordlymanner, as they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninnywarriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates.”“Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply. “Peter Pansave me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.”She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, andhe would answer condescendingly, “It is good. Peter Pan hasspoken.”Always when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that theymust now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were byno means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as justordinary braves. They said “How-do?” to them, and things like that;and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal ahousewife to listen to any complaints against father. “Father knowsbest,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her privateopinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night ofNights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietlygathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in theirblankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were havingtheir evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The wayyou got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay nearhim till the clock struck.The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board,guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter andrecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To be sure,she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, andthen excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. Therewas a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer thematter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying,“I complain of so-and-so;” but what usually happened was that theyforgot to do this or did it too much.“Silence,” cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had toldthem that they were not all to speak at once. “Is your mug empty,Slightly darling?”“Not quite empty, mummy,” Slightly said, after looking into animaginary mug.“He hasn’t even begun to drink his milk,” Nibs interposed.This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.“I complain of Nibs,” he cried promptly.John, however, had held up his hand first.“Well, John?”“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”“Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised.“Certainly not.”“He is not really our father,” John answered. “Hedidn’t even know how a father does till I showed him.”This was grumbling. “We complain of John,” cried the twins.Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he wasthe only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.“I don’t suppose,” Tootles said diffidently, “that Icould be father.”“No, Tootles.”Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of going on.“As I can’t be father,” he said heavily, “I don’tsuppose, Michael, you would let me be baby?”“No, I won’t,” Michael rapped out. He was already in hisbasket.“As I can’t be baby,” Tootles said, getting heavier andheavier and heavier, “do you think I could be a twin?”“No, indeed,” replied the twins; “it’s awfullydifficult to be a twin.”“As I can’t be anything important,” said Tootles,“would any of you like to see me do a trick?”“No,” they all replied.Then at last he stopped. “I hadn’t really any hope,” he said.The hateful telling broke out again.“Slightly is coughing on the table.”“The twins began with cheese-cakes.”“Curly is taking both butter and honey.”“Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”“I complain of the twins.”“I complain of Curly.”“I complain of Nibs.”“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimesthink that spinsters are to be envied.”She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy load ofstockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.“Wendy,” remonstrated Michael, “I’m too big for acradle.”“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly,“and you are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to haveabout a house.”While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancinglimbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this,in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognizeit.“Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet him atthe door.”Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.“Watch well, braves. I have spoken.”And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his tree. As sooften before, but never again.He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.“Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered.“Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun.“It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whisperedto Curly.“I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly.The first twin came to Peter. “Father, we want to dance.”“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high goodhumour.“But we want you to dance.”Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to bescandalised.“Me! My old bones would rattle!”“And mummy too.”“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful,dance!”“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had longlost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special theysaid this was Saturday night, and then they did it.“Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.“People of our figure, Wendy!”“But it is only among our own progeny.”“True, true.”So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first.“Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by thefire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothingmore pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is overthan to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfullygratified. “Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”“Michael takes after you.”She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.“Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course,I have now passed my best, but you don’t want to change me, doyou?”“No, Wendy.”Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.“Peter, what is it?”“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is onlymake-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly.“You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make meseem so old to be their real father.”“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.“Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctlyheard his sigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speakfirmly, “what are your exact feelings to me?”“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at theextreme end of the room.“You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lilyis just the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it isnot my mother.”“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Nowwe know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.“Then what is it?”“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “PerhapsTinker Bell will tell me.”“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully.“She is an abandoned little creature.”Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out somethingimpudent.“She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.He had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.“I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! Butshe had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before thenight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance gave themone more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let usrejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They sang and danced in theirnight-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended tobe frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows wouldclose in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariouslygay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it!It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, thepillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may nevermeet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’sgood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but thebeginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others buthimself, and he said gloomily:“Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is theend.”And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story theyloved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story heleft the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had doneeither of those things this time they might all still be on the island. Butto-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened."

She is not dead, is she?”“Oh, no.”“I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Areyou glad, John?”“Of course I am.”“Are you glad, Nibs?”“Rather.”“Are you glad, Twins?”“We are glad.”“Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.“Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that sheshould have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.“The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr.Darling, and her name was Mrs. Darling.”“I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.“I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.“They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what doyou think they had?”“White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.“No.”“It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story byheart.“Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”“What is descendants?”“Well, you are one, Twin.”“Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”“Descendants are only children,” said John.“Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three childrenhad a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her andchained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”“It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.“They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, wherethe lost children are.”“I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “Idon’t know how it is, but I just thought they did!”“O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost childrencalled Tootles?”“Yes, he was.”“I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”“Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parentswith all their children flown away.”“Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering thefeelings of the unhappy parents one jot.“Think of the empty beds!”“Oo!”“It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.“I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the secondtwin. “Do you, Nibs?”“I’m frightfully anxious.”“If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told themtriumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to thepart that Peter hated.“I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs witha pillow. “Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”“I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.“You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew thatthe mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by;so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”“Did they ever go back?”“Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,“take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves thetwist that makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, andwho is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”“O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if hedidn’t know.“Can it be—yes—no—it is—the fair Wendy!”“Oh!”“And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown toman’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”“Oh!”“‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards,‘there is the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for oursublime faith in a mother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummyand daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw aveil.”That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narratorherself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip like the mostheartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive;and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of specialattention we nobly return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded insteadof smacked.So great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt theycould afford to be callous for a bit longer.But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he uttered ahollow groan.“What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he wasill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it,Peter?”“It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.“Then what kind is it?”“Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; andwith a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.“Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother wouldalways keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons andmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgottenall about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.”I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scaredthem.“Are you sure mothers are like that?”“Yes.”So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when heshould give in. “Wendy, let us go home,” cried John and Michaeltogether.“Yes,” she said, clutching them.“Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in whatthey called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, andthat it is only the mothers who think you can’t.“At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought hadcome to her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and shesaid to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessaryarrangements?”“If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him topass the nuts.Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind theparting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath againstgrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he gotinside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate ofabout five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in the Neverlandthat, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them offvindictively as fast as possible.Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to thehome, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence. Panic-strickenat the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced upon herthreateningly.“It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.“We shan’t let her go.”“Let’s keep her prisoner.”“Ay, chain her up.”In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.“Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped hissilliness and spoke with dignity.“I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But thefirst who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood himseverely.”He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The othersheld back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they wouldget no support from him. He would keep no girl in the Neverland against herwill.“Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked theredskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”“Thank you, Peter.”“Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed tobe obeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her,Nibs.”Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really beensitting up in bed listening for some time.“Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.“You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on ajourney.”Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she wasjolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still moreoffensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.“She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at suchinsubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’schamber.“Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dressat once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in yournegligée.”This made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t gettingup?” she cried.In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped withJohn and Michael for the journey. By this time they were dejected, not merelybecause they were about to lose her, but also because they felt that she wasgoing off to something nice to which they had not been invited. Novelty wasbeckoning to them as usual.Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.“Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feelalmost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.”The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinkingexclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.“But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in themiddle of his jump.“Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will onlymean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind thescreens on first Thursdays.”“Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it forgranted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared.Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearestones.“All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediatelythey rushed to get their things.“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everythingright, “I am going to give you your medicine before you go.” Sheloved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course itwas only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle andcounted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion,however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as she had prepared it,she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.“Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.“No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not goingwith you, Wendy.”“Yes, Peter.”“No.”To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and down theroom, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run about after him,though it was rather undignified.“To find your mother,” she coaxed.Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He could dovery well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered only their badpoints.“No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say Iwas old, and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”“But, Peter—”“No.”And so the others had to be told.“Peter isn’t coming.”Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their backs, andon each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter was not going hehad probably changed his mind about letting them go.But he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” hesaid darkly, “I hope you will like them.”The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of thembegan to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were they notnoodles to want to go?“Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye,Wendy;” and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must reallygo now, for he had something important to do.She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would prefer athimble.“You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.“Yes.”“And you will take your medicine?”“Yes.”That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter, however,was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are you ready,Tinker Bell?” he called out.“Ay, ay.”“Then lead the way.”Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at thismoment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above,where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash ofsteel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendyfell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms wereextended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseechinghim mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same hethought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye."

Thewhite men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonderundulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction tobe too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced onesclutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleepingtranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savagescouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. Thebrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitationof the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and someof them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So thechill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the palefacewho has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand thoseghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how thenight is marching.That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that indisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and theirwhole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They leftnothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. Withthat alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair ofcivilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from themoment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space oftime the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hookhad landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined bybraves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only onehillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he mustestablish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thusmapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins foldedtheir blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, thepearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home, awaiting the coldmoment when they should deal pale death.Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they wereto put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by thetreacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scoutsas escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the risingground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: nothought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visitedhis subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; onhe pounded with no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do,masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trothelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gavepathetic utterance to the coyote cry.Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and theysuddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from theireyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would theytorture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it;but as their father’s sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they hadtime to gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they risenquickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. Itis written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence ofthe white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have beento them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if thefoe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, theyseized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now toolate.It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thusperished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did theydie, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more,and among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and theAlsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, whoultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant ofthe tribe.To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for thehistorian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour heand his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is onlyfair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was toacquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the otherhand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategyof no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannotat least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bolda scheme, and the fell genius with which it was carried out.What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain wouldhis dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, theygathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through theirferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, buthis face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood alooffrom his followers in spirit as in substance.The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he hadcome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should getat the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chieflyPan.Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatredof him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this andthe increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to thecrocodile’s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness sorelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peterwhich goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was nothis engaging appearance, it was not—. There is no beating about the bush,for we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter’scockiness.This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at nightit disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt thathe was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? Heran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggleduncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles.In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of theweapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing withoutstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, andtheir arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost assuddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that inthe passing it has determined their fate.Which side had won?The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the questionput by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat thetom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.”Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudiblyof course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook signedhim to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of thedreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admiredHook so much.Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully.“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indianvictory!”The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black heartsabove, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. Thispuzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a basedelight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at eachother and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: oneman to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yardsapart."

The first to emergefrom his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flunghim to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flunghim to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at thefeet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in thisruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales ofgoods flung from hand to hand.A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironicalpoliteness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted herto the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, hewas so frightfully distingué, that she was too fascinated to cry out.She was only a little girl.Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and wetell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtilyunhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have beenhurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not havebeen present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying hewould not have discovered Slightly’s secret, and without the secret hecould not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter’s life.They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees closeto their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a ropeinto nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly’s turn came, when hewas found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string ingoing round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked himin their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kickthe string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay theirviolence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merelysweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in onepart he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far beneathSlightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and hisexultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knewthat Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown outcould use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, mostwretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterlyregretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he washot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead ofreducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled histree to make it fit him.Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at hismercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterraneancaverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives wereto be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled downhill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook’sgenius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be usedas a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised iton their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful piratechorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don’t knowwhether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound;but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet ofsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pityfor him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night wasto tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided him with apassage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward,so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through hishair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle.Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silentbelow as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more emptytenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the footof Slightly’s tree, with his dagger in his hand?There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softlyto the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, hestepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stopthere and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, helet himself go into the unknown.He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, bitingat his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to thedim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the onlyone on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was thegreat bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a littletime after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather aforlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided notto take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bedoutside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked theminside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn ofthe night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would beif he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in themiddle of it.Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than thedreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams,though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle ofhis existence. At such times it had been Wendy’s custom to take him outof bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her owninvention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite wokeup, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him.But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One armdropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished partof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the littlepearls.Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the treelooking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturbhis sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have beentold) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord);and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred himprofoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly upthe tree, but for one thing.What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The openmouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification ofcockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented toeyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook’s heart. Ifhis rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would havedisregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darknesshimself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, thedoor of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and hehad been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that itwas low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that theirritating quality in Peter’s face and figure visibly increased, and herattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape himafter all?But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’smedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it wasstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadfuldrug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into hispossession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown toscience, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.Five drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but itwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at thesleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Thenone long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his waywith difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spiritof evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, hewound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal hisperson from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and mutteringstrangely to himself, stole away through the trees.Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement indarkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o’clockby the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew notwhat. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for hisdagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.“Who is that?”For long there was no answer: then again the knock.“Who are you?”No answer.He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached thedoor. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture, so that he couldnot see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.“Let me in, Peter.”It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her faceflushed and her dress stained with mud.“What is it?”“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him threeguesses. “Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammaticalsentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, shetold of the capture of Wendy and the boys.Peter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on thepirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As heleapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take hismedicine.His hand closed on the fatal draught.“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about hisdeed as he sped through the forest.“Why not?”“It is poisoned.”“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”“Hook.”“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the darksecret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left noroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fellasleep.”He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of herlightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained itto the dregs.“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I amgoing to be dead.”“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”“Yes.”“But why, Tink?”Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on hisshoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear “Yousilly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near herin distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if itwent out she would be no more. She liked his tears so much that she put out herbeautiful finger and let them run over it.Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then hemade it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again ifchildren believed in fairies.Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time;but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who weretherefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, andnaked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.“Do you believe?” he cried.Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again shewasn’t sure.“What do you think?” she asked Peter.“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands;don’t let Tink die.”Many clapped.Some didn’t.A few beasts hissed.The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to theirnurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved. Firsther voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashingthrough the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought ofthanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones whohad hissed.“And now to rescue Wendy!”The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirtwith weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. Itwas not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping notfar from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but inthat fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadowthrough the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that hewas astir.He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange namesthat they are very wild and difficult of approach.There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at whichhappily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not be sure thatthe children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliteratedall footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a spaceNature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the childrensomething of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily andTinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forgetit. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance,Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at someimportant place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and hecould not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not amovement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, orstalking him from behind.He swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a spaceon which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at theready. He was frightfully happy."

She was the cannibal ofthe seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in thehorror of her name.She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her couldhave reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save thewhir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious andobliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he wasso infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unawareof it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and morethan once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook’s tears andmade it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quiteunconscious.A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of thenight; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and theexhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, whereeven in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out ofHook’s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph.Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were inthe brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days whenhe had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle isman, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out bythe winds of his success?But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of hissombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude ofthe night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man neverfelt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferiorto him.Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this dateset the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines mustalready have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditionsstill clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned.Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress inwhich he grappled her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school’sdistinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form.Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this is allthat really matters.From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through themcame a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep.“Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal question.“Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.“Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” thetap-tap from his school replied.“I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “andFlint feared Barbecue.”“Barbecue, Flint—what house?” came the cutting retort.Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about goodform?His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper thanthe iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallowcountenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across hisface, but there was no damming that trickle.Ah, envy not Hook.There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as ifPeter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire tomake his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it.“Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had lessambition!” It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himselfin the third person.“No little children to love me!”Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him before;perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he muttered tohimself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction thatall children feared him.Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night whodid not already love him. He had said horrid things to them and hit them withthe palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had onlyclung to him the more. Michael had tried on his spectacles.To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it, but itseemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do theyfind Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was. IfSmee was lovable, what was it that made him so? A terrible answer suddenlypresented itself—“Good form?”Had the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form ofall?He remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it beforeyou are eligible for Pop.With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he didnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection:“To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”“Bad form!”The unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward like a cutflower.His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed;and they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to his feet atonce, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passedover him.“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor inyou;” and at once the din was hushed. “Are all the childrenchained, so that they cannot fly away?”“Ay, ay.”“Then hoist them up.”The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and rangedin line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence. Helolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, andfingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touchof colour to his face.“Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk theplank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it tobe?”“Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’sinstructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hatedthe idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would beprudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhatsilly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. Allchildren know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constantuse of it.So Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think mymother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,Slightly?”He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t thinkso,” as if he wished things had been otherwise. “Would your motherlike you to be a pirate, Twin?”“I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as theothers. “Nibs, would—”“Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.“You, boy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you hada little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he wasstruck by Hook’s picking him out.“I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he saiddiffidently.“And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if youjoin.”“What do you think, Michael?” asked John.“What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.“Blackbeard Joe.”Michael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” Hewanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.“Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.Through Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear,‘Down with the King.’”Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.“Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.“And I refuse,” cried Michael.“Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,“That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparingthe fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up.No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the boysthere was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw wasthat the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on thegrimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger “Dirtypig”; and she had already written it on several. But as the boys gatheredround her she had no thought, of course, save for them.“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you areto see your children walk the plank.”Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled hisruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture hetried to hide it, but he was too late.“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightfulcontempt that he nearly fainted.“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he calledgloatingly, “for a mother’s last words to her children.”At this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dearboys,” she said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you fromyour real mothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die likeEnglish gentlemen.’”Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I amgoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”“What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”“What my mother hopes. John, what are—”But Hook had found his voice again.“Tie her up!” he shouted.It was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” hewhispered, “I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almostrather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully.It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to themast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were aboutto take. They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, forthe capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy. Hisintention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking theplank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguishhe hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead.It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.They all heard it—pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head wasblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but towardHook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that frombeing actors they were suddenly become spectators.Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if he hadbeen clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought,“The crocodile is about to board the ship!”Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic partof what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any other manwould have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain ofHook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees alongthe deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleareda passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks thathe spoke.“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was comingaboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boysso that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the crocodile climbingit. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was nocrocodile that was coming to their aid. It was Peter.He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rousesuspicion. Then he went on ticking."

Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discoverthat we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t know how long, but, say,half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last wesaw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and hisdagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticinganything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not beenticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that theclock had run down.Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creaturethus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how hecould turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wildbeasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. Heticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among thosewho heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose ofregaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it wasagain ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to afixed idea, it was a stupid beast.Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legsencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element.Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know.As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this time.” He hadticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doingit. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of thetick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; andhe was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst asabject as if he had heard the crocodile.The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. Atfirst he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behindhim swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash heunderstood the situation. “How clever of me!” he thought at once,and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from theforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by yourwatch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fatedpirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boyscaught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was castoverboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken?“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; formore than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round. They could heareach other’s distressed breathing now, which showed them that the moreterrible sound had passed.“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.“All’s still again.”Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently that hecould have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and he drewhimself up firmly to his full height.“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating theboys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into thevillainous ditty:“Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,You walks along it so,Till it goes down and you goes downTo Davy Jones below!”To terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, hedanced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he sang; and when hefinished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat before you walk theplank?”At that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteouslythat every pirate smiled.“Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in thecabin.”The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. Theyfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song,his dogs joining in with him:“Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,Its tails are nine, you know,And when they’re writ upon your back—”What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayedby a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and diedaway. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, butto the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.“What was that?” cried Hook.“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin. Hetottered out, haggard.“What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook,towering over him.“The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” repliedCecco in a hollow voice.“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almostgibbering, “but there is something terrible in there: the thing you heardcrowing.”The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seenby Hook.“Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetchme out that doodle-doo.”Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,no”; but Hook was purring to his claw.“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more singing,all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow.No one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “’S’death and oddsfish,” he thundered, “who is to bring me that doodle-doo?”“Wait till Cecco comes out,” growled Starkey, and the others tookup the cry.“I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,” said Hook, purring again.“No, by thunder!” Starkey cried.“My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “Iwonder if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?”“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly,and again he had the support of the crew.“Is this mutiny?” asked Hook more pleasantly than ever.“Starkey’s ringleader!”“Captain, mercy!” Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.“Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up Hookadvanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing scream thepirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea.“Four,” said Slightly.“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemensay mutiny?” Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacinggesture, “I’ll bring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said,and sped into the cabin.“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to beready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.“Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.“Something!” echoed Mullins.“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and themutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and Cooksoncried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s accurst is whenthere’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards thepirate craft last. Had he a tail, captain?”“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “thatwhen he comes it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one afteranother took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this thechildren could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten hisprisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion.Open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for theirlives. If they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them,we’re none the worse.”For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding.The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door wasclosed on them.“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared toface the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for thereappearance of Peter.She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which he hadgone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and nowthey all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find. First signingthem to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds, and then nothing could have beeneasier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, anoath, “Hook or me this time.” So when he had freed Wendy, hewhispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and himself took herplace by the mast, her cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then hetook a great breath and crowed.To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin;and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs hehad made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyesoff them now they would leap at him.“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but neverquailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s aJonah aboard.”“Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”“No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate shipwi’ a woman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’sgone.”Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s.“It’s worth trying,” they said doubtfully.“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at thefigure in the cloak.“There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissedjeeringly.“There’s one,” replied the figure.“Who’s that?”“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spokePeter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ’twas that had beenundoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but withoutconviction.“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and inanother moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had thepirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onsetcame when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, strikingwildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man theywere the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled theboys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leaptinto the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly,who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in theirfaces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reekingswords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang ofweapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonouslycounting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven.I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemedto have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. They haddone for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Againand again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. Hehad lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler, whenanother, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.“Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man ismine.”Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others drew backand formed a ring around them.For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, andPeter with the strange smile upon his face.“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all mydoing.”“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thydoom.”“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have atthee.”Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage toeither blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity;ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe’sdefence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drivethe steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite sonimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hopingsuddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue atRio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again.Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all thistime had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour,you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook’s hand, andhe was at Peter’s mercy.“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peterinvited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with atragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicionsassailed him now.“Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture,“I’m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.”This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peterdid not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle ofgood form.“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword wouldhave severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter flutteredround him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. Andagain and again he darted in and pricked.Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked forlife; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was coldforever.Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.“In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown topieces.”Now, now, he thought, true form will show.But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands, andcalmly flung it overboard.What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was, we maybe glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to thetraditions of his race. The other boys were flying around him now, flouting,scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, hismind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of longago, or being sent up for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.And his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right,and his socks were right.James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.For we have come to his last moment.Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, hesprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that thecrocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that thisknowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he stood onthe bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, heinvited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.“Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.Thus perished James Hook.“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in hisfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reachedthe shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for alltheir papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforthwandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living bysaying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared.Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watchingPeter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominentagain. She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showedher the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook’scabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said“half-past one!”The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got them tobed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter,who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the sideof Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for along time, and Wendy held him tightly."

",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,THE RETURN HOME,"By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for there wasa big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among them, with arope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned pirateclothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the truenautical roll and hitching their trousers.It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and secondmate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the mast, and livedin the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; buthe piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped theywould do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scumof Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them. Thebluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered himlustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round,and nosed her for the mainland.Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if thisweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, afterwhich it would save time to fly.Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour ofkeeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared notexpress their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant obedience was theonly safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to takesoundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lullWendy’s suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suitwas ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some ofHook’s wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that onthe first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook’scigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger,which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate homefrom which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. Itseems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be surethat Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look withsorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, “Don’t besilly; what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children.” Solong as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; andthey may lay to that.Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawfuloccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of themto see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do notgo out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why on earth should theirbeds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry?Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that theirparents were spending the week-end in the country? It would be the moral lessonthey have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things inthis way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the wayauthors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be hereon Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendyand John and Michael are looking forward. They have been planning it out on theship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout of joy, Nana’s leapthrough the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared foris a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news inadvance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendyher mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here arethose boys again.” However, we should get no thanks even for this. We arebeginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she wouldupbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure.“But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that bytelling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”“Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes ofdelight.”“Oh, if you look at it in that way!”“What other way is there in which to look at it?”You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say extraordinarilynice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of them will I say now.She does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready.All the beds are aired, and she never leaves the house, and observe, the windowis open. For all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship.However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are,lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, inthe hope that some of them will hurt.The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and sixthe kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt inhis bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up, and that fromfirst to last she had been wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he wasquite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had beenable to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and alion’s courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought thematter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down onall fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dearinvitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:“No, my own one, this is the place for me.”In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kenneluntil his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr.Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave up doing it. Andthere never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he satin the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and alltheir pretty ways.Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into thekennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, whichconveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way at six.Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we rememberhow sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose everymovement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he must have sufferedtorture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised hislittle home, and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who lookedinside.It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning ofit leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followedthe cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph;interviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited him todinner and added, “Do come in the kennel.”On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaitingGeorge’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look at herclosely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now justbecause she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say nastythings about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children, shecouldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep.The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her handmoves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peterbest, and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make herhappy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They arereally within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we needwhisper is that they are on the way. Let’s.It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and thereis no one in the room but Nana.“O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on hermistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel wasbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see thathis face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no imagination,and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside,the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he wasnaturally not unmoved.“Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”“Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.“There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faintflush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some time hesat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success,and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would notbe turned by it.“But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if Ihad been a weak man!”“And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorseas ever, aren’t you?”“Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in akennel.”“But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are notenjoying it?”“My love!”You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he curledround in the kennel.“Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nurserypiano?” and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he addedthoughtlessly, “And shut that window. I feel a draught.”“O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left openfor them, always, always.”Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery andplayed, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John and Michaelflew into the room.Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement plannedby them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then,for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.Peter’s first words tell all.“Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it!That’s right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendycomes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to goback with me.”Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminatedthe pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort thechildren to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then hepeeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink,“It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so prettyas my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as mymother’s was.”Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes braggedabout her.He did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knewit was saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he criedexultantly, “You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window isbarred!”He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw that Mrs.Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on hereyes.“She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but Iwon’t, not I!”He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken theirplace.“She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He wasangry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.The reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t bothhave her, lady.”But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He ceased tolook at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He skipped about andmade funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him,knocking.“Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred thewindow. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at thelaws of nature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and heflew away.Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, whichof course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the floor, quiteunashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his home.“John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think Ihave been here before.”“Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”“So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.“I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed acrossto look into it.“Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.But John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a maninside it.”“It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.“Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a goodlook. “He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with suchfrank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have beensad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in thekennel.“Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory,“he used not to sleep in the kennel?”“John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’tremember the old life as well as we thought we did.”A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.“It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John,“not to be here when we come back.”It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.“It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.“So it is!” said John.“Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who wassurely sleepy.“Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse,“it was quite time we came back.”“Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands overher eyes.”But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had abetter plan.“Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just asif we had never been away.”And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husbandwas asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for her cry of joy,but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. Yousee, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought thiswas just the dream hanging around her still.She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had nursedthem.They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three ofthem.“Mother!” Wendy cried.“That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was thedream.“Mother!”“That’s John,” she said.“Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.“That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her armsfor the three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, theydid, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed andrun to her.“George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darlingwoke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been alovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who wasstaring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that other childrencan never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from whichhe must be for ever barred."

They were waiting belowto give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted fivehundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought thiswould make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling,with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to havelooked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darlingwas curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather largenumber.“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t dothings by halves,” a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointedat them.The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you thinkwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go away.”“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. Heknew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear oneshowing himself in such an unfavourable light.Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to have themas she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as wellas hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house.“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly.“Do you think he is a cypher, Curly?”“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdlygratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room ifthey fitted in.“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am notsure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s allthe same. Hoop la!”He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoopla!” and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forgetwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fittedin.As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not exactlycome to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could openit if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.“Oh dear, are you going away?”“Yes.”“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “thatyou would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”“No.”“About me, Peter?”“No.”Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye onWendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would liketo adopt him also.“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.“Yes.”“And then to an office?”“I suppose so.”“Soon I would be a man?”“Very soon.”“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” hetold her passionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’smother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!”“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in abeard;” and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsedher.“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”“But where are you going to live?”“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put ithigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightenedher grip.“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who wasnow quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for thefirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there arealways new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve onesare boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just littlesillies who are not sure what they are.”“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sittingby the fire.”“I shall have Tink.”“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” shereminded him a little tartly.“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round thecorner.“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.“O Peter, you know it matters.”“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”“May I, mummy?”“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”“But he does so need a mother.”“So do you, my love.”“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politenessmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsomeoffer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning.Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to herthat spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gayagain. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I havetold you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was becauseWendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning timecomes?”Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’skiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily.Funny. But she seemed satisfied.Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, butSlightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the topclass. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had beennot to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settleddown to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have tosay that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet tothe bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of theirdiversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceasedto tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they letgo of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want ofpractice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longerbelieved.Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so hewas with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flewaway with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in theNeverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become;but he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but newadventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of thearch enemy.“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how youkilled him and saved all our lives?”“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her hesaid, “Who is Tinker Bell?”“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he couldnot remember.“There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is nomore.”I expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are solittle that a short time seems a good while to them.Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter;it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly asfascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little houseon the tree tops.Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the oldone simply would not meet; but he never came.“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.“You know he is never ill.”Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there isno such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael hadnot been crying.Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knewhe had missed a year.That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer shetried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue tohim when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and wentwithout bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a marriedwoman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which shehad kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She wasone of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own freewill a day quicker than other girls.All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worthwhile saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curlyany day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michaelis an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord.You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to beTootles. The bearded man who doesn’t know any story to tell his childrenwas once John.Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peterdid not alight in the church and forbid the banns.Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be writtenin ink but in a golden splash.She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from themoment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she wasold enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear ofPeter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from whichthe famous flight had taken place. It was Jane’s nursery now, for herfather had bought it at the three per cents from Wendy’s father, who wasno longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and hernurse’s; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She diedof old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; beingvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children exceptherself.Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it wasWendy’s part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It wasJane’s invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and herown, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:“What do we see now?”“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with afeeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a littlegirl.”“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me,how time flies!”“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew whenyou were a little girl?”“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever didreally fly.”“Yes, you did.”“The dear old days when I could fly!”“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget theway.”“Why do they forget the way?”“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is onlythe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay andinnocent and heartless.”Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew inlooking for his shadow.“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on withsoap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on forhim.”“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the storybetter than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying,what did you say?”“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are youcrying?’”“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and thepirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under theground, and the little house.”“Yes! which did you like best of all?”“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting forme, and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”“Yes.”“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile.She was as grown up as that.“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’scrow.“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was likethis;” and she did it ever so much better than her mother.Wendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the onlyone who heard it awake.”“Lucky you,” said Jane.And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and thestory had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendywas sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, forthere was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard acrow. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had allhis first teeth.He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daringto move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he wasthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might havebeen the nightgown in which he had seen her first.“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small aspossible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go ofme.”“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.“John is not here now,” she gasped.“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Janeas well as to Peter.“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment shouldfall on her.Peter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”“Yes.”“Boy or girl?”“Girl.”Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to flyaway with you?”“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly,“Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I haveforgotten how to fly.”“I’ll soon teach you again.”“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?”he cried, shrinking.“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can seefor yourself.”For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girlheart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they werewet-eyed smiles.Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and whenthe tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew backsharply.“What is it?” he cried again.She had to tell him.“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up longago.”“You promised not to!”“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”“No, you’re not.”“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”“No, she’s not.”But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with hisdagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor insteadand sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could havedone it so easily once. She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the roomto try to think.Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and wasinterested at once.“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.“Hullo,” he said.“Hullo,” said Jane.“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.“Yes, I know.”“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her tothe Neverland.”“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting foryou.”When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowinggloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemnecstasy.“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stoodby his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when theygazed at him.“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knowsit so well as I.”“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and theshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about.Wendy rushed to the window.“No, no,” she cried.“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wantsme always to do his spring cleaning.”“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of hershows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were assmall as stars.As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figurelittle again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a common grown-up,with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when heforgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where shetells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaretgrows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn;and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.THE END"

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Cyclone,"Dorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle Henry, whowas a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer’s wife. Their house wassmall, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. Therewere four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this roomcontained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for the dishes, a table, threeor four chairs, and the beds. Uncle Henry and Aunt Em had a big bed in onecorner, and Dorothy a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all,and no cellar—except a small hole dug in the ground, called a cyclonecellar, where the family could go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose,mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a trap doorin the middle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, darkhole.When Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see nothing butthe great gray prairie on every side. Not a tree nor a house broke the broadsweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all directions.The sun had baked the plowed land into a gray mass, with little cracks runningthrough it. Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops ofthe long blades until they were the same gray color to be seen everywhere. Oncethe house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rainswashed it away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.When Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife. The sun and windhad changed her, too. They had taken the sparkle from her eyes and left them asober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks and lips, and they were grayalso. She was thin and gaunt, and never smiled now. When Dorothy, who was anorphan, first came to her, Aunt Em had been so startled by the child’slaughter that she would scream and press her hand upon her heart wheneverDorothy’s merry voice reached her ears; and she still looked at thelittle girl with wonder that she could find anything to laugh at.Uncle Henry never laughed. He worked hard from morning till night and did notknow what joy was. He was gray also, from his long beard to his rough boots,and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray as herother surroundings. Toto was not gray; he was a little black dog, with longsilky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on either side of hisfunny, wee nose. Toto played all day long, and Dorothy played with him, andloved him dearly.Today, however, they were not playing. Uncle Henry sat upon the doorstep andlooked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than usual. Dorothy stood inthe door with Toto in her arms, and looked at the sky too. Aunt Em was washingthe dishes.From the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry andDorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the coming storm.There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the south, and as they turnedtheir eyes that way they saw ripples in the grass coming from that directionalso.Suddenly Uncle Henry stood up.“There’s a cyclone coming, Em,” he called to his wife.“I’ll go look after the stock.” Then he ran toward the shedswhere the cows and horses were kept.Aunt Em dropped her work and came to the door. One glance told her of thedanger close at hand.“Quick, Dorothy!” she screamed. “Run for the cellar!”Toto jumped out of Dorothy’s arms and hid under the bed, and the girlstarted to get him. Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap door in thefloor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark hole. Dorothy caughtToto at last and started to follow her aunt. When she was halfway across theroom there came a great shriek from the wind, and the house shook so hard thatshe lost her footing and sat down suddenly upon the floor.Then a strange thing happened.The house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the air.Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.The north and south winds met where the house stood, and made it the exactcenter of the cyclone. In the middle of a cyclone the air is generally still,but the great pressure of the wind on every side of the house raised it uphigher and higher, until it was at the very top of the cyclone; and there itremained and was carried miles and miles away as easily as you could carry afeather.It was very dark, and the wind howled horribly around her, but Dorothy foundshe was riding quite easily. After the first few whirls around, and one othertime when the house tipped badly, she felt as if she were being rocked gently,like a baby in a cradle.Toto did not like it. He ran about the room, now here, now there, barkingloudly; but Dorothy sat quite still on the floor and waited to see what wouldhappen.Once Toto got too near the open trap door, and fell in; and at first the littlegirl thought she had lost him. But soon she saw one of his ears sticking upthrough the hole, for the strong pressure of the air was keeping him up so thathe could not fall. She crept to the hole, caught Toto by the ear, and draggedhim into the room again, afterward closing the trap door so that no moreaccidents could happen.Hour after hour passed away, and slowly Dorothy got over her fright; but shefelt quite lonely, and the wind shrieked so loudly all about her that shenearly became deaf. At first she had wondered if she would be dashed to pieceswhen the house fell again; but as the hours passed and nothing terriblehappened, she stopped worrying and resolved to wait calmly and see what thefuture would bring. At last she crawled over the swaying floor to her bed, andlay down upon it; and Toto followed and lay down beside her.In spite of the swaying of the house and the wailing of the wind, Dorothy soonclosed her eyes and fell fast asleep."

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Council with the Munchkins,"She was awakened by a shock, so sudden and severe that if Dorothy had not beenlying on the soft bed she might have been hurt. As it was, the jar made hercatch her breath and wonder what had happened; and Toto put his cold littlenose into her face and whined dismally. Dorothy sat up and noticed that thehouse was not moving; nor was it dark, for the bright sunshine came in at thewindow, flooding the little room. She sprang from her bed and with Toto at herheels ran and opened the door.The little girl gave a cry of amazement and looked about her, her eyes growingbigger and bigger at the wonderful sights she saw.The cyclone had set the house down very gently—for a cyclone—in themidst of a country of marvelous beauty. There were lovely patches of greenswardall about, with stately trees bearing rich and luscious fruits. Banks ofgorgeous flowers were on every hand, and birds with rare and brilliant plumagesang and fluttered in the trees and bushes. A little way off was a small brook,rushing and sparkling along between green banks, and murmuring in a voice verygrateful to a little girl who had lived so long on the dry, gray prairies.While she stood looking eagerly at the strange and beautiful sights, shenoticed coming toward her a group of the queerest people she had ever seen.They were not as big as the grown folk she had always been used to; but neitherwere they very small. In fact, they seemed about as tall as Dorothy, who was awell-grown child for her age, although they were, so far as looks go, manyyears older.Three were men and one a woman, and all were oddly dressed. They wore roundhats that rose to a small point a foot above their heads, with little bellsaround the brims that tinkled sweetly as they moved. The hats of the men wereblue; the little woman’s hat was white, and she wore a white gown thathung in pleats from her shoulders. Over it were sprinkled little stars thatglistened in the sun like diamonds. The men were dressed in blue, of the sameshade as their hats, and wore well-polished boots with a deep roll of blue atthe tops. The men, Dorothy thought, were about as old as Uncle Henry, for twoof them had beards. But the little woman was doubtless much older. Her face wascovered with wrinkles, her hair was nearly white, and she walked ratherstiffly.When these people drew near the house where Dorothy was standing in thedoorway, they paused and whispered among themselves, as if afraid to comefarther. But the little old woman walked up to Dorothy, made a low bow andsaid, in a sweet voice:“You are welcome, most noble Sorceress, to the land of the Munchkins. Weare so grateful to you for having killed the Wicked Witch of the East, and forsetting our people free from bondage.”Dorothy listened to this speech with wonder. What could the little womanpossibly mean by calling her a sorceress, and saying she had killed the WickedWitch of the East? Dorothy was an innocent, harmless little girl, who had beencarried by a cyclone many miles from home; and she had never killed anything inall her life.But the little woman evidently expected her to answer; so Dorothy said, withhesitation, “You are very kind, but there must be some mistake. I havenot killed anything.”“Your house did, anyway,” replied the little old woman, with alaugh, “and that is the same thing. See!” she continued, pointingto the corner of the house. “There are her two feet, still sticking outfrom under a block of wood.”Dorothy looked, and gave a little cry of fright. There, indeed, just under thecorner of the great beam the house rested on, two feet were sticking out, shodin silver shoes with pointed toes.“Oh, dear! Oh, dear!” cried Dorothy, clasping her hands together indismay. “The house must have fallen on her. Whatever shall we do?”“There is nothing to be done,” said the little woman calmly.“But who was she?” asked Dorothy.“She was the Wicked Witch of the East, as I said,” answered thelittle woman. “She has held all the Munchkins in bondage for many years,making them slave for her night and day. Now they are all set free, and aregrateful to you for the favor.”“Who are the Munchkins?” inquired Dorothy.“They are the people who live in this land of the East where the WickedWitch ruled.”“Are you a Munchkin?” asked Dorothy.“No, but I am their friend, although I live in the land of the North.When they saw the Witch of the East was dead the Munchkins sent a swiftmessenger to me, and I came at once. I am the Witch of the North.”“Oh, gracious!” cried Dorothy. “Are you a real witch?”“Yes, indeed,” answered the little woman. “But I am a goodwitch, and the people love me. I am not as powerful as the Wicked Witch was whoruled here, or I should have set the people free myself.”“But I thought all witches were wicked,” said the girl, who washalf frightened at facing a real witch.“Oh, no, that is a great mistake.There were only four witches in all the Land of Oz, and two of them, those wholive in the North and the South, are good witches. I know this is true, for Iam one of them myself, and cannot be mistaken. Those who dwelt in the East andthe West were, indeed, wicked witches; but now that you have killed one ofthem, there is but one Wicked Witch in all the Land of Oz—the one wholives in the West.”“But,” said Dorothy, after a moment’s thought, “Aunt Emhas told me that the witches were all dead—years and years ago.”“Who is Aunt Em?” inquired the little old woman.“She is my aunt who lives in Kansas, where I came from.”The Witch of the North seemed to think for a time, with her head bowed and hereyes upon the ground. Then she looked up and said, “I do not know whereKansas is, for I have never heard that country mentioned before. But tell me,is it a civilized country?”“Oh, yes,” replied Dorothy.“Then that accounts for it. In the civilized countries I believe thereare no witches left, nor wizards, nor sorceresses, nor magicians. But, you see,the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the restof the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us.”“Who are the wizards?” asked Dorothy.“Oz himself is the Great Wizard,” answered the Witch, sinking hervoice to a whisper. “He is more powerful than all the rest of ustogether. He lives in the City of Emeralds.”Dorothy was going to ask another question, but just then the Munchkins, who hadbeen standing silently by, gave a loud shout and pointed to the corner of thehouse where the Wicked Witch had been lying.“What is it?” asked the little old woman, and looked, and began tolaugh. The feet of the dead Witch had disappeared entirely, and nothing wasleft but the silver shoes.“She was so old,” explained the Witch of the North, “that shedried up quickly in the sun. That is the end of her. But the silver shoes areyours, and you shall have them to wear.” She reached down and picked upthe shoes, and after shaking the dust out of them handed them to Dorothy.“The Witch of the East was proud of those silver shoes,” said oneof the Munchkins, “and there is some charm connected with them; but whatit is we never knew.”Dorothy carried the shoes into the house and placed them on the table. Then shecame out again to the Munchkins and said:“I am anxious to get back to my aunt and uncle, for I am sure they willworry about me. Can you help me find my way?”The Munchkins and the Witch first looked at one another, and then at Dorothy,and then shook their heads.“At the East, not far from here,” said one, “there is a greatdesert, and none could live to cross it.”“It is the same at the South,” said another, “for I have beenthere and seen it. The South is the country of the Quadlings.”“I am told,” said the third man, “that it is the same at theWest. And that country, where the Winkies live, is ruled by the Wicked Witch ofthe West, who would make you her slave if you passed her way.”“The North is my home,” said the old lady, “and at its edgeis the same great desert that surrounds this Land of Oz. I’m afraid, mydear, you will have to live with us.”Dorothy began to sob at this, for she felt lonely among all these strangepeople. Her tears seemed to grieve the kind-hearted Munchkins, for theyimmediately took out their handkerchiefs and began to weep also. As for thelittle old woman, she took off her cap and balanced the point on the end of hernose, while she counted “One, two, three” in a solemn voice. Atonce the cap changed to a slate, on which was written in big, white chalkmarks:“LET DOROTHY GO TO THE CITY OF EMERALDS”The little old woman took the slate from her nose, and having read the words onit, asked, “Is your name Dorothy, my dear?”“Yes,” answered the child, looking up and drying her tears.“Then you must go to the City of Emeralds. Perhaps Oz will helpyou.”“Where is this city?” asked Dorothy.“It is exactly in the center of the country, and is ruled by Oz, theGreat Wizard I told you of.”“Is he a good man?” inquired the girl anxiously.“He is a good Wizard. Whether he is a man or not I cannot tell, for Ihave never seen him.”“How can I get there?” asked Dorothy.“You must walk. It is a long journey, through a country that is sometimespleasant and sometimes dark and terrible. However, I will use all the magicarts I know of to keep you from harm.”“Won’t you go with me?” pleaded the girl, who had begun tolook upon the little old woman as her only friend.“No, I cannot do that,” she replied, “but I will give you mykiss, and no one will dare injure a person who has been kissed by the Witch ofthe North.”She came close to Dorothy and kissed her gently on the forehead. Where her lipstouched the girl they left a round, shining mark, as Dorothy found out soonafter.“The road to the City of Emeralds is paved with yellow brick,” saidthe Witch, “so you cannot miss it. When you get to Oz do not be afraid ofhim, but tell your story and ask him to help you. Good-bye, my dear.”The three Munchkins bowed low to her and wished her a pleasant journey, afterwhich they walked away through the trees. The Witch gave Dorothy a friendlylittle nod, whirled around on her left heel three times, and straightwaydisappeared, much to the surprise of little Toto, who barked after her loudlyenough when she had gone, because he had been afraid even to growl while shestood by.But Dorothy, knowing her to be a witch, had expected her to disappear in justthat way, and was not surprised in the least."

So she went to thecupboard and cut herself some bread, which she spread with butter. She gavesome to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to thelittle brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. Toto ran over to thetrees and began to bark at the birds sitting there. Dorothy went to get him,and saw such delicious fruit hanging from the branches that she gathered someof it, finding it just what she wanted to help out her breakfast.Then she went back to the house, and having helped herself and Toto to a gooddrink of the cool, clear water, she set about making ready for the journey tothe City of Emeralds.Dorothy had only one other dress, but that happened to be clean and was hangingon a peg beside her bed. It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; andalthough the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a prettyfrock. The girl washed herself carefully, dressed herself in the clean gingham,and tied her pink sunbonnet on her head. She took a little basket and filled itwith bread from the cupboard, laying a white cloth over the top. Then shelooked down at her feet and noticed how old and worn her shoes were.“They surely will never do for a long journey, Toto,” she said. AndToto looked up into her face with his little black eyes and wagged his tail toshow he knew what she meant.At that moment Dorothy saw lying on the table the silver shoes that hadbelonged to the Witch of the East.“I wonder if they will fit me,” she said to Toto. “They wouldbe just the thing to take a long walk in, for they could not wear out.”She took off her old leather shoes and tried on the silver ones, which fittedher as well as if they had been made for her.Finally she picked up her basket.“Come along, Toto,” she said. “We will go to the Emerald Cityand ask the Great Oz how to get back to Kansas again.”She closed the door, locked it, and put the key carefully in the pocket of herdress. And so, with Toto trotting along soberly behind her, she started on herjourney.There were several roads nearby, but it did not take her long to find the onepaved with yellow bricks. Within a short time she was walking briskly towardthe Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellowroad-bed. The sun shone bright and the birds sang sweetly, and Dorothy did notfeel nearly so bad as you might think a little girl would who had been suddenlywhisked away from her own country and set down in the midst of a strange land.She was surprised, as she walked along, to see how pretty the country was abouther. There were neat fences at the sides of the road, painted a dainty bluecolor, and beyond them were fields of grain and vegetables in abundance.Evidently the Munchkins were good farmers and able to raise large crops. Oncein a while she would pass a house, and the people came out to look at her andbow low as she went by; for everyone knew she had been the means of destroyingthe Wicked Witch and setting them free from bondage. The houses of theMunchkins were odd-looking dwellings, for each was round, with a big dome for aroof. All were painted blue, for in this country of the East blue was thefavorite color.Toward evening, when Dorothy was tired with her long walk and began to wonderwhere she should pass the night, she came to a house rather larger than therest. On the green lawn before it many men and women were dancing. Five littlefiddlers played as loudly as possible, and the people were laughing andsinging, while a big table near by was loaded with delicious fruits and nuts,pies and cakes, and many other good things to eat.The people greeted Dorothy kindly, and invited her to supper and to pass thenight with them; for this was the home of one of the richest Munchkins in theland, and his friends were gathered with him to celebrate their freedom fromthe bondage of the Wicked Witch.Dorothy ate a hearty supper and was waited upon by the rich Munchkin himself,whose name was Boq. Then she sat upon a settee and watched the people dance.When Boq saw her silver shoes he said, “You must be a greatsorceress.”“Why?” asked the girl.“Because you wear silver shoes and have killed the Wicked Witch. Besides,you have white in your frock, and only witches and sorceresses wearwhite.”“My dress is blue and white checked,” said Dorothy, smoothing outthe wrinkles in it.“It is kind of you to wear that,” said Boq. “Blue is thecolor of the Munchkins, and white is the witch color. So we know you are afriendly witch.”Dorothy did not know what to say to this, for all the people seemed to thinkher a witch, and she knew very well she was only an ordinary little girl whohad come by the chance of a cyclone into a strange land.When she had tired watching the dancing, Boq led her into the house, where hegave her a room with a pretty bed in it. The sheets were made of blue cloth,and Dorothy slept soundly in them till morning, with Toto curled up on the bluerug beside her.She ate a hearty breakfast, and watched a wee Munchkin baby, who played withToto and pulled his tail and crowed and laughed in a way that greatly amusedDorothy. Toto was a fine curiosity to all the people, for they had never seen adog before.“How far is it to the Emerald City?” the girl asked.“I do not know,” answered Boq gravely, “for I have never beenthere. It is better for people to keep away from Oz, unless they have businesswith him. But it is a long way to the Emerald City, and it will take you manydays. The country here is rich and pleasant, but you must pass through roughand dangerous places before you reach the end of your journey.”This worried Dorothy a little, but she knew that only the Great Oz could helpher get to Kansas again, so she bravely resolved not to turn back.She bade her friends good-bye, and again started along the road of yellowbrick. When she had gone several miles she thought she would stop to rest, andso climbed to the top of the fence beside the road and sat down. There was agreat cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placedhigh on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn.Dorothy leaned her chin upon her hand and gazed thoughtfully at the Scarecrow.Its head was a small sack stuffed with straw, with eyes, nose, and mouthpainted on it to represent a face. An old, pointed blue hat, that had belongedto some Munchkin, was perched on his head, and the rest of the figure was ablue suit of clothes, worn and faded, which had also been stuffed with straw.On the feet were some old boots with blue tops, such as every man wore in thiscountry, and the figure was raised above the stalks of corn by means of thepole stuck up its back.While Dorothy was looking earnestly into the queer, painted face of theScarecrow, she was surprised to see one of the eyes slowly wink at her. Shethought she must have been mistaken at first, for none of the scarecrows inKansas ever wink; but presently the figure nodded its head to her in a friendlyway. Then she climbed down from the fence and walked up to it, while Toto ranaround the pole and barked.“Good day,” said the Scarecrow, in a rather husky voice.“Did you speak?” asked the girl, in wonder.“Certainly,” answered the Scarecrow. “How do you do?”“I’m pretty well, thank you,” replied Dorothy politely.“How do you do?”“I’m not feeling well,” said the Scarecrow, with a smile,“for it is very tedious being perched up here night and day to scare awaycrows.”“Can’t you get down?” asked Dorothy.“No, for this pole is stuck up my back. If you will please take away thepole I shall be greatly obliged to you.”Dorothy reached up both arms and lifted the figure off the pole, for, beingstuffed with straw, it was quite light.“Thank you very much,” said the Scarecrow, when he had been setdown on the ground. “I feel like a new man.”Dorothy was puzzled at this, for it sounded queer to hear a stuffed man speak,and to see him bow and walk along beside her.“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow when he had stretched himselfand yawned. “And where are you going?”“My name is Dorothy,” said the girl, “and I am going to theEmerald City, to ask the Great Oz to send me back to Kansas.”“Where is the Emerald City?” he inquired. “And who isOz?”“Why, don’t you know?” she returned, in surprise.“No, indeed. I don’t know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so Ihave no brains at all,” he answered sadly.“Oh,” said Dorothy, “I’m awfully sorry for you.”“Do you think,” he asked, “if I go to the Emerald City withyou, that Oz would give me some brains?”“I cannot tell,” she returned, “but you may come with me, ifyou like. If Oz will not give you any brains you will be no worse off than youare now.”“That is true,” said the Scarecrow. “You see,” hecontinued confidentially, “I don’t mind my legs and arms and bodybeing stuffed, because I cannot get hurt. If anyone treads on my toes or sticksa pin into me, it doesn’t matter, for I can’t feel it. But I do notwant people to call me a fool, and if my head stays stuffed with straw insteadof with brains, as yours is, how am I ever to know anything?”“I understand how you feel,” said the little girl, who was trulysorry for him. “If you will come with me I’ll ask Oz to do all hecan for you.”“Thank you,” he answered gratefully.They walked back to the road. Dorothy helped him over the fence, and theystarted along the path of yellow brick for the Emerald City.Toto did not like this addition to the party at first. He smelled around thestuffed man as if he suspected there might be a nest of rats in the straw, andhe often growled in an unfriendly way at the Scarecrow.“Don’t mind Toto,” said Dorothy to her new friend. “Henever bites.”“Oh, I’m not afraid,” replied the Scarecrow. “Hecan’t hurt the straw. Do let me carry that basket for you. I shall notmind it, for I can’t get tired. I’ll tell you a secret,” hecontinued, as he walked along. “There is only one thing in the world I amafraid of.”“What is that?” asked Dorothy; “the Munchkin farmer who madeyou?”“No,” answered the Scarecrow; “it’s a lightedmatch.”"

Sometimes, indeed, they were broken or missing altogether, leavingholes that Toto jumped across and Dorothy walked around. As for the Scarecrow,having no brains, he walked straight ahead, and so stepped into the holes andfell at full length on the hard bricks. It never hurt him, however, and Dorothywould pick him up and set him upon his feet again, while he joined her inlaughing merrily at his own mishap.The farms were not nearly so well cared for here as they were farther back.There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went themore dismal and lonesome the country became.At noon they sat down by the roadside, near a little brook, and Dorothy openedher basket and got out some bread. She offered a piece to the Scarecrow, but herefused.“I am never hungry,” he said, “and it is a lucky thing I amnot, for my mouth is only painted, and if I should cut a hole in it so I couldeat, the straw I am stuffed with would come out, and that would spoil the shapeof my head.”Dorothy saw at once that this was true, so she only nodded and went on eatingher bread.“Tell me something about yourself and the country you came from,”said the Scarecrow, when she had finished her dinner. So she told him all aboutKansas, and how gray everything was there, and how the cyclone had carried herto this queer Land of Oz.The Scarecrow listened carefully, and said, “I cannot understand why youshould wish to leave this beautiful country and go back to the dry, gray placeyou call Kansas.”“That is because you have no brains” answered the girl. “Nomatter how dreary and gray our homes are, we people of flesh and blood wouldrather live there than in any other country, be it ever so beautiful. There isno place like home.”The Scarecrow sighed.“Of course I cannot understand it,” he said. “If your headswere stuffed with straw, like mine, you would probably all live in thebeautiful places, and then Kansas would have no people at all. It is fortunatefor Kansas that you have brains.”“Won’t you tell me a story, while we are resting?” asked thechild.The Scarecrow looked at her reproachfully, and answered:“My life has been so short that I really know nothing whatever. I wasonly made day before yesterday. What happened in the world before that time isall unknown to me. Luckily, when the farmer made my head, one of the firstthings he did was to paint my ears, so that I heard what was going on. Therewas another Munchkin with him, and the first thing I heard was the farmersaying, ‘How do you like those ears?’“‘They aren’t straight,’” answered the other.“‘Never mind,’” said the farmer. “‘They areears just the same,’” which was true enough.“‘Now I’ll make the eyes,’” said the farmer. Sohe painted my right eye, and as soon as it was finished I found myself lookingat him and at everything around me with a great deal of curiosity, for this wasmy first glimpse of the world.“‘That’s a rather pretty eye,’” remarked theMunchkin who was watching the farmer. “‘Blue paint is just thecolor for eyes.’“‘I think I’ll make the other a little bigger,’”said the farmer. And when the second eye was done I could see much better thanbefore. Then he made my nose and my mouth. But I did not speak, because at thattime I didn’t know what a mouth was for. I had the fun of watching themmake my body and my arms and legs; and when they fastened on my head, at last,I felt very proud, for I thought I was just as good a man as anyone.“‘This fellow will scare the crows fast enough,’ said thefarmer. ‘He looks just like a man.’“‘Why, he is a man,’ said the other, and I quite agreed withhim. The farmer carried me under his arm to the cornfield, and set me up on atall stick, where you found me. He and his friend soon after walked away andleft me alone.“I did not like to be deserted this way. So I tried to walk after them.But my feet would not touch the ground, and I was forced to stay on that pole.It was a lonely life to lead, for I had nothing to think of, having been madesuch a little while before. Many crows and other birds flew into the cornfield,but as soon as they saw me they flew away again, thinking I was a Munchkin; andthis pleased me and made me feel that I was quite an important person. By andby an old crow flew near me, and after looking at me carefully he perched uponmy shoulder and said:“‘I wonder if that farmer thought to fool me in this clumsy manner.Any crow of sense could see that you are only stuffed with straw.’ Thenhe hopped down at my feet and ate all the corn he wanted. The other birds,seeing he was not harmed by me, came to eat the corn too, so in a short timethere was a great flock of them about me.“I felt sad at this, for it showed I was not such a good Scarecrow afterall; but the old crow comforted me, saying, ‘If you only had brains inyour head you would be as good a man as any of them, and a better man than someof them. Brains are the only things worth having in this world, no matterwhether one is a crow or a man.’“After the crows had gone I thought this over, and decided I would tryhard to get some brains. By good luck you came along and pulled me off thestake, and from what you say I am sure the Great Oz will give me brains as soonas we get to the Emerald City.”“I hope so,” said Dorothy earnestly, “since you seem anxiousto have them.”“Oh, yes; I am anxious,” returned the Scarecrow. “It is suchan uncomfortable feeling to know one is a fool.”“Well,” said the girl, “let us go.” And she handed thebasket to the Scarecrow.There were no fences at all by the roadside now, and the land was rough anduntilled. Toward evening they came to a great forest, where the trees grew sobig and close together that their branches met over the road of yellow brick.It was almost dark under the trees, for the branches shut out the daylight; butthe travelers did not stop, and went on into the forest.“If this road goes in, it must come out,” said the Scarecrow,“and as the Emerald City is at the other end of the road, we must gowherever it leads us.”“Anyone would know that,” said Dorothy.“Certainly; that is why I know it,” returned the Scarecrow.“If it required brains to figure it out, I never should have saidit.”After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumblingalong in the darkness. Dorothy could not see at all, but Toto could, for somedogs see very well in the dark; and the Scarecrow declared he could see as wellas by day. So she took hold of his arm and managed to get along fairly well.“If you see any house, or any place where we can pass the night,”she said, “you must tell me; for it is very uncomfortable walking in thedark.”Soon after the Scarecrow stopped.“I see a little cottage at the right of us,” he said, “builtof logs and branches. Shall we go there?”“Yes, indeed,” answered the child. “I am all tiredout.”So the Scarecrow led her through the trees until they reached the cottage, andDorothy entered and found a bed of dried leaves in one corner. She lay down atonce, and with Toto beside her soon fell into a sound sleep. The Scarecrow, whowas never tired, stood up in another corner and waited patiently until morningcame."

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Rescue of the Tin Woodman,"When Dorothy awoke the sun was shining through the trees and Toto had long beenout chasing birds around him and squirrels. She sat up and looked around her.There was the Scarecrow, still standing patiently in his corner, waiting forher.“We must go and search for water,” she said to him.“Why do you want water?” he asked.“To wash my face clean after the dust of the road, and to drink, so thedry bread will not stick in my throat.”“It must be inconvenient to be made of flesh,” said the Scarecrowthoughtfully, “for you must sleep, and eat and drink. However, you havebrains, and it is worth a lot of bother to be able to think properly.”They left the cottage and walked through the trees until they found a littlespring of clear water, where Dorothy drank and bathed and ate her breakfast.She saw there was not much bread left in the basket, and the girl was thankfulthe Scarecrow did not have to eat anything, for there was scarcely enough forherself and Toto for the day.When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellowbrick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by.“What was that?” she asked timidly.“I cannot imagine,” replied the Scarecrow; “but we can go andsee.”Just then another groan reached their ears, and the sound seemed to come frombehind them. They turned and walked through the forest a few steps, whenDorothy discovered something shining in a ray of sunshine that fell between thetrees. She ran to the place and then stopped short, with a little cry ofsurprise.One of the big trees had been partly chopped through, and standing beside it,with an uplifted axe in his hands, was a man made entirely of tin. His head andarms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, asif he could not stir at all.Dorothy looked at him in amazement, and so did the Scarecrow, while Toto barkedsharply and made a snap at the tin legs, which hurt his teeth.“Did you groan?” asked Dorothy.“Yes,” answered the tin man, “I did. I’ve been groaningfor more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to helpme.”“What can I do for you?” she inquired softly, for she was moved bythe sad voice in which the man spoke.“Get an oil-can and oil my joints,” he answered. “They arerusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soonbe all right again. You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage.”Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then shereturned and asked anxiously, “Where are your joints?”“Oil my neck, first,” replied the Tin Woodman. So she oiled it, andas it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and movedit gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turnit himself.“Now oil the joints in my arms,” he said. And Dorothy oiled themand the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust andas good as new.The Tin Woodman gave a sigh of satisfaction and lowered his axe, which heleaned against the tree.“This is a great comfort,” he said. “I have been holding thataxe in the air ever since I rusted, and I’m glad to be able to put itdown at last. Now, if you will oil the joints of my legs, I shall be all rightonce more.”So they oiled his legs until he could move them freely; and he thanked themagain and again for his release, for he seemed a very polite creature, and verygrateful.“I might have stood there always if you had not come along,” hesaid; “so you have certainly saved my life. How did you happen to behere?”“We are on our way to the Emerald City to see the Great Oz,” sheanswered, “and we stopped at your cottage to pass the night.”“Why do you wish to see Oz?” he asked.“I want him to send me back to Kansas, and the Scarecrow wants him to puta few brains into his head,” she replied.The Tin Woodman appeared to think deeply for a moment. Then he said:“Do you suppose Oz could give me a heart?”“Why, I guess so,” Dorothy answered. “It would be as easy asto give the Scarecrow brains.”“True,” the Tin Woodman returned. “So, if you will allow meto join your party, I will also go to the Emerald City and ask Oz to helpme.”“Come along,” said the Scarecrow heartily, and Dorothy added thatshe would be pleased to have his company. So the Tin Woodman shouldered his axeand they all passed through the forest until they came to the road that waspaved with yellow brick.The Tin Woodman had asked Dorothy to put the oil-can in her basket.“For,” he said, “if I should get caught in the rain, and rustagain, I would need the oil-can badly.”It was a bit of good luck to have their new comrade join the party, for soonafter they had begun their journey again they came to a place where the treesand branches grew so thick over the road that the travelers could not pass. Butthe Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon hecleared a passage for the entire party.Dorothy was thinking so earnestly as they walked along that she did not noticewhen the Scarecrow stumbled into a hole and rolled over to the side of theroad. Indeed he was obliged to call to her to help him up again.“Why didn’t you walk around the hole?” asked the Tin Woodman.“I don’t know enough,” replied the Scarecrow cheerfully.“My head is stuffed with straw, you know, and that is why I am going toOz to ask him for some brains.”“Oh, I see,” said the Tin Woodman. “But, after all, brainsare not the best things in the world.”“Have you any?” inquired the Scarecrow.“No, my head is quite empty,” answered the Woodman. “But onceI had brains, and a heart also; so, having tried them both, I should muchrather have a heart.”“And why is that?” asked the Scarecrow.“I will tell you my story, and then you will know.”So, while they were walking through the forest, the Tin Woodman told thefollowing story:“I was born the son of a woodman who chopped down trees in the forest andsold the wood for a living. When I grew up, I too became a wood-chopper, andafter my father died I took care of my old mother as long as she lived. Then Imade up my mind that instead of living alone I would marry, so that I might notbecome lonely.“There was one of the Munchkin girls who was so beautiful that I soongrew to love her with all my heart. She, on her part, promised to marry me assoon as I could earn enough money to build a better house for her; so I set towork harder than ever. But the girl lived with an old woman who did not wanther to marry anyone, for she was so lazy she wished the girl to remain with herand do the cooking and the housework. So the old woman went to the Wicked Witchof the East, and promised her two sheep and a cow if she would prevent themarriage. Thereupon the Wicked Witch enchanted my axe, and when I was choppingaway at my best one day, for I was anxious to get the new house and my wife assoon as possible, the axe slipped all at once and cut off my left leg.“This at first seemed a great misfortune, for I knew a one-legged mancould not do very well as a wood-chopper. So I went to a tinsmith and had himmake me a new leg out of tin. The leg worked very well, once I was used to it.But my action angered the Wicked Witch of the East, for she had promised theold woman I should not marry the pretty Munchkin girl. When I began choppingagain, my axe slipped and cut off my right leg. Again I went to the tinsmith,and again he made me a leg out of tin. After this the enchanted axe cut off myarms, one after the other; but, nothing daunted, I had them replaced with tinones. The Wicked Witch then made the axe slip and cut off my head, and at firstI thought that was the end of me. But the tinsmith happened to come along, andhe made me a new head out of tin.“I thought I had beaten the Wicked Witch then, and I worked harder thanever; but I little knew how cruel my enemy could be. She thought of a new wayto kill my love for the beautiful Munchkin maiden, and made my axe slip again,so that it cut right through my body, splitting me into two halves. Once morethe tinsmith came to my help and made me a body of tin, fastening my tin armsand legs and head to it, by means of joints, so that I could move around aswell as ever. But, alas! I had now no heart, so that I lost all my love for theMunchkin girl, and did not care whether I married her or not. I suppose she isstill living with the old woman, waiting for me to come after her.“My body shone so brightly in the sun that I felt very proud of it and itdid not matter now if my axe slipped, for it could not cut me. There was onlyone danger—that my joints would rust; but I kept an oil-can in my cottageand took care to oil myself whenever I needed it. However, there came a daywhen I forgot to do this, and, being caught in a rainstorm, before I thought ofthe danger my joints had rusted, and I was left to stand in the woods until youcame to help me. It was a terrible thing to undergo, but during the year Istood there I had time to think that the greatest loss I had known was the lossof my heart. While I was in love I was the happiest man on earth; but no onecan love who has not a heart, and so I am resolved to ask Oz to give me one. Ifhe does, I will go back to the Munchkin maiden and marry her.”Both Dorothy and the Scarecrow had been greatly interested in the story of theTin Woodman, and now they knew why he was so anxious to get a new heart.“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “I shall ask for brainsinstead of a heart; for a fool would not know what to do with a heart if he hadone.”“I shall take the heart,” returned the Tin Woodman; “forbrains do not make one happy, and happiness is the best thing in theworld.”Dorothy did not say anything, for she was puzzled to know which of her twofriends was right, and she decided if she could only get back to Kansas andAunt Em, it did not matter so much whether the Woodman had no brains and theScarecrow no heart, or each got what he wanted.What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal forherself and Toto would empty the basket. To be sure, neither the Woodman northe Scarecrow ever ate anything, but she was not made of tin nor straw, andcould not live unless she was fed."

The road was still paved with yellow brick, but these were much coveredby dried branches and dead leaves from the trees, and the walking was not atall good.There were few birds in this part of the forest, for birds love the opencountry where there is plenty of sunshine. But now and then there came a deepgrowl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. These sounds made thelittle girl’s heart beat fast, for she did not know what made them; butToto knew, and he walked close to Dorothy’s side, and did not even barkin return.“How long will it be,” the child asked of the Tin Woodman,“before we are out of the forest?”“I cannot tell,” was the answer, “for I have never been tothe Emerald City. But my father went there once, when I was a boy, and he saidit was a long journey through a dangerous country, although nearer to the citywhere Oz dwells the country is beautiful. But I am not afraid so long as I havemy oil-can, and nothing can hurt the Scarecrow, while you bear upon yourforehead the mark of the Good Witch’s kiss, and that will protect youfrom harm.”“But Toto!” said the girl anxiously. “What will protecthim?”“We must protect him ourselves if he is in danger,” replied the TinWoodman.Just as he spoke there came from the forest a terrible roar, and the nextmoment a great Lion bounded into the road. With one blow of his paw he sent theScarecrow spinning over and over to the edge of the road, and then he struck atthe Tin Woodman with his sharp claws. But, to the Lion’s surprise, hecould make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the roadand lay still.Little Toto, now that he had an enemy to face, ran barking toward the Lion, andthe great beast had opened his mouth to bite the dog, when Dorothy, fearingToto would be killed, and heedless of danger, rushed forward and slapped theLion upon his nose as hard as she could, while she cried out:“Don’t you dare to bite Toto! You ought to be ashamed of yourself,a big beast like you, to bite a poor little dog!”“I didn’t bite him,” said the Lion, as he rubbed his nosewith his paw where Dorothy had hit it.“No, but you tried to,” she retorted. “You are nothing but abig coward.”“I know it,” said the Lion, hanging his head in shame.“I’ve always known it. But how can I help it?”“I don’t know, I’m sure. To think of your striking a stuffedman, like the poor Scarecrow!”“Is he stuffed?” asked the Lion in surprise, as he watched her pickup the Scarecrow and set him upon his feet, while she patted him into shapeagain.“Of course he’s stuffed,” replied Dorothy, who was stillangry.“That’s why he went over so easily,” remarked the Lion.“It astonished me to see him whirl around so. Is the other one stuffedalso?”“No,” said Dorothy, “he’s made of tin.” And shehelped the Woodman up again.“That’s why he nearly blunted my claws,” said the Lion.“When they scratched against the tin it made a cold shiver run down myback. What is that little animal you are so tender of?”“He is my dog, Toto,” answered Dorothy.“Is he made of tin, or stuffed?” asked the Lion.“Neither. He’s a—a—a meat dog,” said the girl.“Oh! He’s a curious animal and seems remarkably small, now that Ilook at him. No one would think of biting such a little thing, except a cowardlike me,” continued the Lion sadly.“What makes you a coward?” asked Dorothy, looking at the greatbeast in wonder, for he was as big as a small horse.“It’s a mystery,” replied the Lion. “I suppose I wasborn that way. All the other animals in the forest naturally expect me to bebrave, for the Lion is everywhere thought to be the King of Beasts. I learnedthat if I roared very loudly every living thing was frightened and got out ofmy way. Whenever I’ve met a man I’ve been awfully scared; but Ijust roared at him, and he has always run away as fast as he could go. If theelephants and the tigers and the bears had ever tried to fight me, I shouldhave run myself—I’m such a coward; but just as soon as they hear meroar they all try to get away from me, and of course I let them go.”“But that isn’t right. The King of Beasts shouldn’t be acoward,” said the Scarecrow.“I know it,” returned the Lion, wiping a tear from his eye with thetip of his tail. “It is my great sorrow, and makes my life very unhappy.But whenever there is danger, my heart begins to beat fast.”“Perhaps you have heart disease,” said the Tin Woodman.“It may be,” said the Lion.“If you have,” continued the Tin Woodman, “you ought to beglad, for it proves you have a heart. For my part, I have no heart; so I cannothave heart disease.”“Perhaps,” said the Lion thoughtfully, “if I had no heart Ishould not be a coward.”“Have you brains?” asked the Scarecrow.“I suppose so. I’ve never looked to see,” replied the Lion.“I am going to the Great Oz to ask him to give me some,” remarkedthe Scarecrow, “for my head is stuffed with straw.”“And I am going to ask him to give me a heart,” said the Woodman.“And I am going to ask him to send Toto and me back to Kansas,”added Dorothy.“Do you think Oz could give me courage?” asked the Cowardly Lion.“Just as easily as he could give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.“Or give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.“Or send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.“Then, if you don’t mind, I’ll go with you,” said theLion, “for my life is simply unbearable without a bit of courage.”“You will be very welcome,” answered Dorothy, “for you willhelp to keep away the other wild beasts. It seems to me they must be morecowardly than you are if they allow you to scare them so easily.”“They really are,” said the Lion, “but that doesn’tmake me any braver, and as long as I know myself to be a coward I shall beunhappy.”So once more the little company set off upon the journey, the Lion walking withstately strides at Dorothy’s side. Toto did not approve of this newcomrade at first, for he could not forget how nearly he had been crushedbetween the Lion’s great jaws. But after a time he became more at ease,and presently Toto and the Cowardly Lion had grown to be good friends.During the rest of that day there was no other adventure to mar the peace oftheir journey. Once, indeed, the Tin Woodman stepped upon a beetle that wascrawling along the road, and killed the poor little thing. This made the TinWoodman very unhappy, for he was always careful not to hurt any livingcreature; and as he walked along he wept several tears of sorrow and regret.These tears ran slowly down his face and over the hinges of his jaw, and therethey rusted. When Dorothy presently asked him a question the Tin Woodman couldnot open his mouth, for his jaws were tightly rusted together. He becamegreatly frightened at this and made many motions to Dorothy to relieve him, butshe could not understand. The Lion was also puzzled to know what was wrong. Butthe Scarecrow seized the oil-can from Dorothy’s basket and oiled theWoodman’s jaws, so that after a few moments he could talk as well asbefore.“This will serve me a lesson,” said he, “to look where Istep. For if I should kill another bug or beetle I should surely cry again, andcrying rusts my jaws so that I cannot speak.”Thereafter he walked very carefully, with his eyes on the road, and when he sawa tiny ant toiling by he would step over it, so as not to harm it. The TinWoodman knew very well he had no heart, and therefore he took great care neverto be cruel or unkind to anything.“You people with hearts,” he said, “have something to guideyou, and need never do wrong; but I have no heart, and so I must be verycareful. When Oz gives me a heart of course I needn’t mind somuch.”"

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Journey to the Great Oz,"They were obliged to camp out that night under a large tree in the forest, forthere were no houses near. The tree made a good, thick covering to protect themfrom the dew, and the Tin Woodman chopped a great pile of wood with his axe andDorothy built a splendid fire that warmed her and made her feel less lonely.She and Toto ate the last of their bread, and now she did not know what theywould do for breakfast.“If you wish,” said the Lion, “I will go into the forest andkill a deer for you. You can roast it by the fire, since your tastes are sopeculiar that you prefer cooked food, and then you will have a very goodbreakfast.”“Don’t! Please don’t,” begged the Tin Woodman. “Ishould certainly weep if you killed a poor deer, and then my jaws would rustagain.”But the Lion went away into the forest and found his own supper, and no oneever knew what it was, for he didn’t mention it. And the Scarecrow founda tree full of nuts and filled Dorothy’s basket with them, so that shewould not be hungry for a long time. She thought this was very kind andthoughtful of the Scarecrow, but she laughed heartily at the awkward way inwhich the poor creature picked up the nuts. His padded hands were so clumsy andthe nuts were so small that he dropped almost as many as he put in the basket.But the Scarecrow did not mind how long it took him to fill the basket, for itenabled him to keep away from the fire, as he feared a spark might get into hisstraw and burn him up. So he kept a good distance away from the flames, andonly came near to cover Dorothy with dry leaves when she lay down to sleep.These kept her very snug and warm, and she slept soundly until morning.When it was daylight, the girl bathed her face in a little rippling brook, andsoon after they all started toward the Emerald City.This was to be an eventful day for the travelers. They had hardly been walkingan hour when they saw before them a great ditch that crossed the road anddivided the forest as far as they could see on either side. It was a very wideditch, and when they crept up to the edge and looked into it they could see itwas also very deep, and there were many big, jagged rocks at the bottom. Thesides were so steep that none of them could climb down, and for a moment itseemed that their journey must end.“What shall we do?” asked Dorothy despairingly.“I haven’t the faintest idea,” said the Tin Woodman, and theLion shook his shaggy mane and looked thoughtful.But the Scarecrow said, “We cannot fly, that is certain. Neither can weclimb down into this great ditch. Therefore, if we cannot jump over it, we muststop where we are.”“I think I could jump over it,” said the Cowardly Lion, aftermeasuring the distance carefully in his mind.“Then we are all right,” answered the Scarecrow, “for you cancarry us all over on your back, one at a time.”“Well, I’ll try it,” said the Lion. “Who will gofirst?”“I will,” declared the Scarecrow, “for, if you found that youcould not jump over the gulf, Dorothy would be killed, or the Tin Woodman badlydented on the rocks below. But if I am on your back it will not matter so much,for the fall would not hurt me at all.”“I am terribly afraid of falling, myself,” said the Cowardly Lion,“but I suppose there is nothing to do but try it. So get on my back andwe will make the attempt.”The Scarecrow sat upon the Lion’s back, and the big beast walked to theedge of the gulf and crouched down.“Why don’t you run and jump?” asked the Scarecrow.“Because that isn’t the way we Lions do these things,” hereplied. Then giving a great spring, he shot through the air and landed safelyon the other side. They were all greatly pleased to see how easily he did it,and after the Scarecrow had got down from his back the Lion sprang across theditch again.Dorothy thought she would go next; so she took Toto in her arms and climbed onthe Lion’s back, holding tightly to his mane with one hand. The nextmoment it seemed as if she were flying through the air; and then, before shehad time to think about it, she was safe on the other side. The Lion went backa third time and got the Tin Woodman, and then they all sat down for a fewmoments to give the beast a chance to rest, for his great leaps had made hisbreath short, and he panted like a big dog that has been running too long.They found the forest very thick on this side, and it looked dark and gloomy.After the Lion had rested they started along the road of yellow brick, silentlywondering, each in his own mind, if ever they would come to the end of thewoods and reach the bright sunshine again. To add to their discomfort, theysoon heard strange noises in the depths of the forest, and the Lion whisperedto them that it was in this part of the country that the Kalidahs lived.“What are the Kalidahs?” asked the girl.“They are monstrous beasts with bodies like bears and heads liketigers,” replied the Lion, “and with claws so long and sharp thatthey could tear me in two as easily as I could kill Toto. I’m terriblyafraid of the Kalidahs.”“I’m not surprised that you are,” returned Dorothy.“They must be dreadful beasts.”The Lion was about to reply when suddenly they came to another gulf across theroad. But this one was so broad and deep that the Lion knew at once he couldnot leap across it.So they sat down to consider what they should do, and after serious thought theScarecrow said:“Here is a great tree, standing close to the ditch. If the Tin Woodmancan chop it down, so that it will fall to the other side, we can walk across iteasily.”“That is a first-rate idea,” said the Lion. “One would almostsuspect you had brains in your head, instead of straw.”The Woodman set to work at once, and so sharp was his axe that the tree wassoon chopped nearly through. Then the Lion put his strong front legs againstthe tree and pushed with all his might, and slowly the big tree tipped and fellwith a crash across the ditch, with its top branches on the other side.They had just started to cross this queer bridge when a sharp growl made themall look up, and to their horror they saw running toward them two great beastswith bodies like bears and heads like tigers.“They are the Kalidahs!” said the Cowardly Lion, beginning totremble.“Quick!” cried the Scarecrow. “Let us cross over.”So Dorothy went first, holding Toto in her arms, the Tin Woodman followed, andthe Scarecrow came next. The Lion, although he was certainly afraid, turned toface the Kalidahs, and then he gave so loud and terrible a roar that Dorothyscreamed and the Scarecrow fell over backward, while even the fierce beastsstopped short and looked at him in surprise.But, seeing they were bigger than the Lion, and remembering that there were twoof them and only one of him, the Kalidahs again rushed forward, and the Lioncrossed over the tree and turned to see what they would do next. Withoutstopping an instant the fierce beasts also began to cross the tree. And theLion said to Dorothy:“We are lost, for they will surely tear us to pieces with their sharpclaws. But stand close behind me, and I will fight them as long as I amalive.”“Wait a minute!” called the Scarecrow. He had been thinking whatwas best to be done, and now he asked the Woodman to chop away the end of thetree that rested on their side of the ditch. The Tin Woodman began to use hisaxe at once, and, just as the two Kalidahs were nearly across, the tree fellwith a crash into the gulf, carrying the ugly, snarling brutes with it, andboth were dashed to pieces on the sharp rocks at the bottom.“Well,” said the Cowardly Lion, drawing a long breath of relief,“I see we are going to live a little while longer, and I am glad of it,for it must be a very uncomfortable thing not to be alive. Those creaturesfrightened me so badly that my heart is beating yet.”“Ah,” said the Tin Woodman sadly, “I wish I had a heart tobeat.”This adventure made the travelers more anxious than ever to get out of theforest, and they walked so fast that Dorothy became tired, and had to ride onthe Lion’s back. To their great joy the trees became thinner the fartherthey advanced, and in the afternoon they suddenly came upon a broad river,flowing swiftly just before them. On the other side of the water they could seethe road of yellow brick running through a beautiful country, with greenmeadows dotted with bright flowers and all the road bordered with trees hangingfull of delicious fruits. They were greatly pleased to see this delightfulcountry before them.“How shall we cross the river?” asked Dorothy.“That is easily done,” replied the Scarecrow. “The TinWoodman must build us a raft, so we can float to the other side.”So the Woodman took his axe and began to chop down small trees to make a raft,and while he was busy at this the Scarecrow found on the riverbank a tree fullof fine fruit. This pleased Dorothy, who had eaten nothing but nuts all day,and she made a hearty meal of the ripe fruit.But it takes time to make a raft, even when one is as industrious and untiringas the Tin Woodman, and when night came the work was not done. So they found acozy place under the trees where they slept well until the morning; and Dorothydreamed of the Emerald City, and of the good Wizard Oz, who would soon send herback to her own home again."

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Deadly Poppy Field,"Our little party of travelers awakened the next morning refreshed and full ofhope, and Dorothy breakfasted like a princess off peaches and plums from thetrees beside the river. Behind them was the dark forest they had passed safelythrough, although they had suffered many discouragements; but before them was alovely, sunny country that seemed to beckon them on to the Emerald City.To be sure, the broad river now cut them off from this beautiful land. But theraft was nearly done, and after the Tin Woodman had cut a few more logs andfastened them together with wooden pins, they were ready to start. Dorothy satdown in the middle of the raft and held Toto in her arms. When the CowardlyLion stepped upon the raft it tipped badly, for he was big and heavy; but theScarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood upon the other end to steady it, and theyhad long poles in their hands to push the raft through the water.They got along quite well at first, but when they reached the middle of theriver the swift current swept the raft downstream, farther and farther awayfrom the road of yellow brick. And the water grew so deep that the long poleswould not touch the bottom.“This is bad,” said the Tin Woodman, “for if we cannot get tothe land we shall be carried into the country of the Wicked Witch of the West,and she will enchant us and make us her slaves.”“And then I should get no brains,” said the Scarecrow.“And I should get no courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.“And I should get no heart,” said the Tin Woodman.“And I should never get back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.“We must certainly get to the Emerald City if we can,” theScarecrow continued, and he pushed so hard on his long pole that it stuck fastin the mud at the bottom of the river. Then, before he could pull it outagain—or let go—the raft was swept away, and the poor Scarecrow wasleft clinging to the pole in the middle of the river.“Good-bye!” he called after them, and they were very sorry to leavehim. Indeed, the Tin Woodman began to cry, but fortunately remembered that hemight rust, and so dried his tears on Dorothy’s apron.Of course this was a bad thing for the Scarecrow.“I am now worse off than when I first met Dorothy,” he thought.“Then, I was stuck on a pole in a cornfield, where I could make-believescare the crows, at any rate. But surely there is no use for a Scarecrow stuckon a pole in the middle of a river. I am afraid I shall never have any brains,after all!”Down the stream the raft floated, and the poor Scarecrow was left far behind.Then the Lion said:“Something must be done to save us. I think I can swim to the shore andpull the raft after me, if you will only hold fast to the tip of mytail.”So he sprang into the water, and the Tin Woodman caught fast hold of his tail.Then the Lion began to swim with all his might toward the shore. It was hardwork, although he was so big; but by and by they were drawn out of the current,and then Dorothy took the Tin Woodman’s long pole and helped push theraft to the land.They were all tired out when they reached the shore at last and stepped offupon the pretty green grass, and they also knew that the stream had carriedthem a long way past the road of yellow brick that led to the Emerald City.“What shall we do now?” asked the Tin Woodman, as the Lion lay downon the grass to let the sun dry him.“We must get back to the road, in some way,” said Dorothy.“The best plan will be to walk along the riverbank until we come to theroad again,” remarked the Lion.So, when they were rested, Dorothy picked up her basket and they started alongthe grassy bank, to the road from which the river had carried them. It was alovely country, with plenty of flowers and fruit trees and sunshine to cheerthem, and had they not felt so sorry for the poor Scarecrow, they could havebeen very happy.They walked along as fast as they could, Dorothy only stopping once to pick abeautiful flower; and after a time the Tin Woodman cried out:“Look!”Then they all looked at the river and saw the Scarecrow perched upon his polein the middle of the water, looking very lonely and sad.“What can we do to save him?” asked Dorothy.The Lion and the Woodman both shook their heads, for they did not know. So theysat down upon the bank and gazed wistfully at the Scarecrow until a Stork flewby, who, upon seeing them, stopped to rest at the water’s edge.“Who are you and where are you going?” asked the Stork.“I am Dorothy,” answered the girl, “and these are my friends,the Tin Woodman and the Cowardly Lion; and we are going to the EmeraldCity.”“This isn’t the road,” said the Stork, as she twisted herlong neck and looked sharply at the queer party.“I know it,” returned Dorothy, “but we have lost theScarecrow, and are wondering how we shall get him again.”“Where is he?” asked the Stork.“Over there in the river,” answered the little girl.“If he wasn’t so big and heavy I would get him for you,”remarked the Stork.“He isn’t heavy a bit,” said Dorothy eagerly, “for heis stuffed with straw; and if you will bring him back to us, we shall thank youever and ever so much.”“Well, I’ll try,” said the Stork, “but if I find he istoo heavy to carry I shall have to drop him in the river again.”So the big bird flew into the air and over the water till she came to where theScarecrow was perched upon his pole. Then the Stork with her great clawsgrabbed the Scarecrow by the arm and carried him up into the air and back tothe bank, where Dorothy and the Lion and the Tin Woodman and Toto were sitting.When the Scarecrow found himself among his friends again, he was so happy thathe hugged them all, even the Lion and Toto; and as they walked along he sang“Tol-de-ri-de-oh!” at every step, he felt so gay.“I was afraid I should have to stay in the river forever,” he said,“but the kind Stork saved me, and if I ever get any brains I shall findthe Stork again and do her some kindness in return.”“That’s all right,” said the Stork, who was flying alongbeside them. “I always like to help anyone in trouble. But I must go now,for my babies are waiting in the nest for me. I hope you will find the EmeraldCity and that Oz will help you.”“Thank you,” replied Dorothy, and then the kind Stork flew into theair and was soon out of sight.They walked along listening to the singing of the brightly colored birds andlooking at the lovely flowers which now became so thick that the ground wascarpeted with them. There were big yellow and white and blue and purpleblossoms, besides great clusters of scarlet poppies, which were so brilliant incolor they almost dazzled Dorothy’s eyes.“Aren’t they beautiful?” the girl asked, as she breathed inthe spicy scent of the bright flowers.“I suppose so,” answered the Scarecrow. “When I have brains,I shall probably like them better.”“If I only had a heart, I should love them,” added the Tin Woodman.“I always did like flowers,” said the Lion. “They seem sohelpless and frail. But there are none in the forest so bright as these.”They now came upon more and more of the big scarlet poppies, and fewer andfewer of the other flowers; and soon they found themselves in the midst of agreat meadow of poppies. Now it is well known that when there are many of theseflowers together their odor is so powerful that anyone who breathes it fallsasleep, and if the sleeper is not carried away from the scent of the flowers,he sleeps on and on forever. But Dorothy did not know this, nor could she getaway from the bright red flowers that were everywhere about; so presently hereyes grew heavy and she felt she must sit down to rest and to sleep.But the Tin Woodman would not let her do this.“We must hurry and get back to the road of yellow brick beforedark,” he said; and the Scarecrow agreed with him. So they kept walkinguntil Dorothy could stand no longer. Her eyes closed in spite of herself andshe forgot where she was and fell among the poppies, fast asleep.“What shall we do?” asked the Tin Woodman.“If we leave her here she will die,” said the Lion. “Thesmell of the flowers is killing us all. I myself can scarcely keep my eyesopen, and the dog is asleep already.”It was true; Toto had fallen down beside his little mistress. But the Scarecrowand the Tin Woodman, not being made of flesh, were not troubled by the scent ofthe flowers.“Run fast,” said the Scarecrow to the Lion, “and get out ofthis deadly flower bed as soon as you can. We will bring the little girl withus, but if you should fall asleep you are too big to be carried.”So the Lion aroused himself and bounded forward as fast as he could go. In amoment he was out of sight.“Let us make a chair with our hands and carry her,” said theScarecrow. So they picked up Toto and put the dog in Dorothy’s lap, andthen they made a chair with their hands for the seat and their arms for thearms and carried the sleeping girl between them through the flowers.On and on they walked, and it seemed that the great carpet of deadly flowersthat surrounded them would never end. They followed the bend of the river, andat last came upon their friend the Lion, lying fast asleep among the poppies.The flowers had been too strong for the huge beast and he had given up at last,and fallen only a short distance from the end of the poppy bed, where the sweetgrass spread in beautiful green fields before them.“We can do nothing for him,” said the Tin Woodman, sadly;“for he is much too heavy to lift. We must leave him here to sleep onforever, and perhaps he will dream that he has found courage at last.”“I’m sorry,” said the Scarecrow. “The Lion was a verygood comrade for one so cowardly. But let us go on.”They carried the sleeping girl to a pretty spot beside the river, far enoughfrom the poppy field to prevent her breathing any more of the poison of theflowers, and here they laid her gently on the soft grass and waited for thefresh breeze to waken her."

It was, indeed, a great yellow Wildcat, and theWoodman thought it must be chasing something, for its ears were lying close toits head and its mouth was wide open, showing two rows of ugly teeth, while itsred eyes glowed like balls of fire. As it came nearer the Tin Woodman saw thatrunning before the beast was a little gray field mouse, and although he had noheart he knew it was wrong for the Wildcat to try to kill such a pretty,harmless creature.So the Woodman raised his axe, and as the Wildcat ran by he gave it a quickblow that cut the beast’s head clean off from its body, and it rolledover at his feet in two pieces.The field mouse, now that it was freed from its enemy, stopped short; andcoming slowly up to the Woodman it said, in a squeaky little voice:“Oh, thank you! Thank you ever so much for saving my life.”“Don’t speak of it, I beg of you,” replied the Woodman.“I have no heart, you know, so I am careful to help all those who mayneed a friend, even if it happens to be only a mouse.”“Only a mouse!” cried the little animal, indignantly. “Why, Iam a Queen—the Queen of all the Field Mice!”“Oh, indeed,” said the Woodman, making a bow.“Therefore you have done a great deed, as well as a brave one, in savingmy life,” added the Queen.At that moment several mice were seen running up as fast as their little legscould carry them, and when they saw their Queen they exclaimed:“Oh, your Majesty, we thought you would be killed! How did you manage toescape the great Wildcat?” They all bowed so low to the little Queen thatthey almost stood upon their heads.“This funny tin man,” she answered, “killed the Wildcat andsaved my life. So hereafter you must all serve him, and obey his slightestwish.”“We will!” cried all the mice, in a shrill chorus. And then theyscampered in all directions, for Toto had awakened from his sleep, and seeingall these mice around him he gave one bark of delight and jumped right into themiddle of the group. Toto had always loved to chase mice when he lived inKansas, and he saw no harm in it.But the Tin Woodman caught the dog in his arms and held him tight, while hecalled to the mice, “Come back! Come back! Toto shall not hurtyou.”At this the Queen of the Mice stuck her head out from underneath a clump ofgrass and asked, in a timid voice, “Are you sure he will not biteus?”“I will not let him,” said the Woodman; “so do not beafraid.”One by one the mice came creeping back, and Toto did not bark again, althoughhe tried to get out of the Woodman’s arms, and would have bitten him hadhe not known very well he was made of tin. Finally one of the biggest micespoke.“Is there anything we can do,” it asked, “to repay you forsaving the life of our Queen?”“Nothing that I know of,” answered the Woodman; but the Scarecrow,who had been trying to think, but could not because his head was stuffed withstraw, said, quickly, “Oh, yes; you can save our friend, the CowardlyLion, who is asleep in the poppy bed.”“A Lion!” cried the little Queen. “Why, he would eat us allup.”“Oh, no,” declared the Scarecrow; “this Lion is acoward.”“Really?” asked the Mouse.“He says so himself,” answered the Scarecrow, “and he wouldnever hurt anyone who is our friend. If you will help us to save him I promisethat he shall treat you all with kindness.”“Very well,” said the Queen, “we trust you. But what shall wedo?”“Are there many of these mice which call you Queen and are willing toobey you?”“Oh, yes; there are thousands,” she replied.“Then send for them all to come here as soon as possible, and let eachone bring a long piece of string.”The Queen turned to the mice that attended her and told them to go at once andget all her people. As soon as they heard her orders they ran away in everydirection as fast as possible.“Now,” said the Scarecrow to the Tin Woodman, “you must go tothose trees by the riverside and make a truck that will carry the Lion.”So the Woodman went at once to the trees and began to work; and he soon made atruck out of the limbs of trees, from which he chopped away all the leaves andbranches. He fastened it together with wooden pegs and made the four wheels outof short pieces of a big tree trunk. So fast and so well did he work that bythe time the mice began to arrive the truck was all ready for them.They came from all directions, and there were thousands of them: big mice andlittle mice and middle-sized mice; and each one brought a piece of string inhis mouth. It was about this time that Dorothy woke from her long sleep andopened her eyes. She was greatly astonished to find herself lying upon thegrass, with thousands of mice standing around and looking at her timidly. Butthe Scarecrow told her about everything, and turning to the dignified littleMouse, he said:“Permit me to introduce to you her Majesty, the Queen.”Dorothy nodded gravely and the Queen made a curtsy, after which she becamequite friendly with the little girl.The Scarecrow and the Woodman now began to fasten the mice to the truck, usingthe strings they had brought. One end of a string was tied around the neck ofeach mouse and the other end to the truck. Of course the truck was a thousandtimes bigger than any of the mice who were to draw it; but when all the micehad been harnessed, they were able to pull it quite easily. Even the Scarecrowand the Tin Woodman could sit on it, and were drawn swiftly by their queerlittle horses to the place where the Lion lay asleep.After a great deal of hard work, for the Lion was heavy, they managed to gethim up on the truck. Then the Queen hurriedly gave her people the order tostart, for she feared if the mice stayed among the poppies too long they alsowould fall asleep.At first the little creatures, many though they were, could hardly stir theheavily loaded truck; but the Woodman and the Scarecrow both pushed frombehind, and they got along better. Soon they rolled the Lion out of the poppybed to the green fields, where he could breathe the sweet, fresh air again,instead of the poisonous scent of the flowers.Dorothy came to meet them and thanked the little mice warmly for saving hercompanion from death. She had grown so fond of the big Lion she was glad he hadbeen rescued.Then the mice were unharnessed from the truck and scampered away through thegrass to their homes. The Queen of the Mice was the last to leave.“If ever you need us again,” she said, “come out into thefield and call, and we shall hear you and come to your assistance.Good-bye!”“Good-bye!” they all answered, and away the Queen ran, whileDorothy held Toto tightly lest he should run after her and frighten her.After this they sat down beside the Lion until he should awaken; and theScarecrow brought Dorothy some fruit from a tree near by, which she ate for herdinner."

How did you get me out?”Then they told him of the field mice, and how they had generously saved himfrom death; and the Cowardly Lion laughed, and said:“I have always thought myself very big and terrible; yet such littlethings as flowers came near to killing me, and such small animals as mice havesaved my life. How strange it all is! But, comrades, what shall we donow?”“We must journey on until we find the road of yellow brick again,”said Dorothy, “and then we can keep on to the Emerald City.”So, the Lion being fully refreshed, and feeling quite himself again, they allstarted upon the journey, greatly enjoying the walk through the soft, freshgrass; and it was not long before they reached the road of yellow brick andturned again toward the Emerald City where the Great Oz dwelt.The road was smooth and well paved, now, and the country about was beautiful,so that the travelers rejoiced in leaving the forest far behind, and with itthe many dangers they had met in its gloomy shades. Once more they could seefences built beside the road; but these were painted green, and when they cameto a small house, in which a farmer evidently lived, that also was paintedgreen. They passed by several of these houses during the afternoon, andsometimes people came to the doors and looked at them as if they would like toask questions; but no one came near them nor spoke to them because of the greatLion, of which they were very much afraid. The people were all dressed inclothing of a lovely emerald-green color and wore peaked hats like those of theMunchkins.“This must be the Land of Oz,” said Dorothy, “and we aresurely getting near the Emerald City.”“Yes,” answered the Scarecrow. “Everything is green here,while in the country of the Munchkins blue was the favorite color. But thepeople do not seem to be as friendly as the Munchkins, and I’m afraid weshall be unable to find a place to pass the night.”“I should like something to eat besides fruit,” said the girl,“and I’m sure Toto is nearly starved. Let us stop at the next houseand talk to the people.”So, when they came to a good-sized farmhouse, Dorothy walked boldly up to thedoor and knocked.A woman opened it just far enough to look out, and said, “What do youwant, child, and why is that great Lion with you?”“We wish to pass the night with you, if you will allow us,”answered Dorothy; “and the Lion is my friend and comrade, and would nothurt you for the world.”“Is he tame?” asked the woman, opening the door a little wider.“Oh, yes,” said the girl, “and he is a great coward, too. Hewill be more afraid of you than you are of him.”“Well,” said the woman, after thinking it over and taking anotherpeep at the Lion, “if that is the case you may come in, and I will giveyou some supper and a place to sleep.”So they all entered the house, where there were, besides the woman, twochildren and a man. The man had hurt his leg, and was lying on the couch in acorner. They seemed greatly surprised to see so strange a company, and whilethe woman was busy laying the table the man asked:“Where are you all going?”“To the Emerald City,” said Dorothy, “to see the GreatOz.”“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed the man. “Are you sure that Oz willsee you?”“Why not?” she replied.“Why, it is said that he never lets anyone come into his presence. I havebeen to the Emerald City many times, and it is a beautiful and wonderful place;but I have never been permitted to see the Great Oz, nor do I know of anyliving person who has seen him.”“Does he never go out?” asked the Scarecrow.“Never. He sits day after day in the great Throne Room of his Palace, andeven those who wait upon him do not see him face to face.”“What is he like?” asked the girl.“That is hard to tell,” said the man thoughtfully. “You see,Oz is a Great Wizard, and can take on any form he wishes. So that some say helooks like a bird; and some say he looks like an elephant; and some say helooks like a cat. To others he appears as a beautiful fairy, or a brownie, orin any other form that pleases him. But who the real Oz is, when he is in hisown form, no living person can tell.”“That is very strange,” said Dorothy, “but we must try, insome way, to see him, or we shall have made our journey for nothing.”“Why do you wish to see the terrible Oz?” asked the man.“I want him to give me some brains,” said the Scarecrow eagerly.“Oh, Oz could do that easily enough,” declared the man. “Hehas more brains than he needs.”“And I want him to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.“That will not trouble him,” continued the man, “for Oz has alarge collection of hearts, of all sizes and shapes.”“And I want him to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.“Oz keeps a great pot of courage in his Throne Room,” said the man,“which he has covered with a golden plate, to keep it from running over.He will be glad to give you some.”“And I want him to send me back to Kansas,” said Dorothy.“Where is Kansas?” asked the man, with surprise.“I don’t know,” replied Dorothy sorrowfully, “but it ismy home, and I’m sure it’s somewhere.”“Very likely. Well, Oz can do anything; so I suppose he will find Kansasfor you. But first you must get to see him, and that will be a hard task; forthe Great Wizard does not like to see anyone, and he usually has his own way.But what do YOU want?” he continued, speaking to Toto. Toto only waggedhis tail; for, strange to say, he could not speak.The woman now called to them that supper was ready, so they gathered around thetable and Dorothy ate some delicious porridge and a dish of scrambled eggs anda plate of nice white bread, and enjoyed her meal. The Lion ate some of theporridge, but did not care for it, saying it was made from oats and oats werefood for horses, not for lions. The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman ate nothingat all. Toto ate a little of everything, and was glad to get a good supperagain.The woman now gave Dorothy a bed to sleep in, and Toto lay down beside her,while the Lion guarded the door of her room so she might not be disturbed. TheScarecrow and the Tin Woodman stood up in a corner and kept quiet all night,although of course they could not sleep.The next morning, as soon as the sun was up, they started on their way, andsoon saw a beautiful green glow in the sky just before them.“That must be the Emerald City,” said Dorothy.As they walked on, the green glow became brighter and brighter, and it seemedthat at last they were nearing the end of their travels. Yet it was afternoonbefore they came to the great wall that surrounded the City. It was high andthick and of a bright green color.In front of them, and at the end of the road of yellow brick, was a big gate,all studded with emeralds that glittered so in the sun that even the paintedeyes of the Scarecrow were dazzled by their brilliancy.There was a bell beside the gate, and Dorothy pushed the button and heard asilvery tinkle sound within. Then the big gate swung slowly open, and they allpassed through and found themselves in a high arched room, the walls of whichglistened with countless emeralds.Before them stood a little man about the same size as the Munchkins. He wasclothed all in green, from his head to his feet, and even his skin was of agreenish tint. At his side was a large green box.When he saw Dorothy and her companions the man asked, “What do you wishin the Emerald City?”“We came here to see the Great Oz,” said Dorothy.The man was so surprised at this answer that he sat down to think it over.“It has been many years since anyone asked me to see Oz,” he said,shaking his head in perplexity. “He is powerful and terrible, and if youcome on an idle or foolish errand to bother the wise reflections of the GreatWizard, he might be angry and destroy you all in an instant.”“But it is not a foolish errand, nor an idle one,” replied theScarecrow; “it is important. And we have been told that Oz is a goodWizard.”“So he is,” said the green man, “and he rules the EmeraldCity wisely and well. But to those who are not honest, or who approach him fromcuriosity, he is most terrible, and few have ever dared ask to see his face. Iam the Guardian of the Gates, and since you demand to see the Great Oz I musttake you to his Palace. But first you must put on the spectacles.”“Why?” asked Dorothy.“Because if you did not wear spectacles the brightness and glory of theEmerald City would blind you. Even those who live in the City must wearspectacles night and day. They are all locked on, for Oz so ordered it when theCity was first built, and I have the only key that will unlock them.”He opened the big box, and Dorothy saw that it was filled with spectacles ofevery size and shape. All of them had green glasses in them. The Guardian ofthe Gates found a pair that would just fit Dorothy and put them over her eyes.There were two golden bands fastened to them that passed around the back of herhead, where they were locked together by a little key that was at the end of achain the Guardian of the Gates wore around his neck. When they were on,Dorothy could not take them off had she wished, but of course she did not wishto be blinded by the glare of the Emerald City, so she said nothing.Then the green man fitted spectacles for the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman andthe Lion, and even on little Toto; and all were locked fast with the key.Then the Guardian of the Gates put on his own glasses and told them he wasready to show them to the Palace. Taking a big golden key from a peg on thewall, he opened another gate, and they all followed him through the portal intothe streets of the Emerald City."

The streets werelined with beautiful houses all built of green marble and studded everywherewith sparkling emeralds. They walked over a pavement of the same green marble,and where the blocks were joined together were rows of emeralds, set closely,and glittering in the brightness of the sun. The window panes were of greenglass; even the sky above the City had a green tint, and the rays of the sunwere green.There were many people—men, women, and children—walking about, andthese were all dressed in green clothes and had greenish skins. They looked atDorothy and her strangely assorted company with wondering eyes, and thechildren all ran away and hid behind their mothers when they saw the Lion; butno one spoke to them. Many shops stood in the street, and Dorothy saw thateverything in them was green. Green candy and green pop-corn were offered forsale, as well as green shoes, green hats, and green clothes of all sorts. Atone place a man was selling green lemonade, and when the children bought itDorothy could see that they paid for it with green pennies.There seemed to be no horses nor animals of any kind; the men carried thingsaround in little green carts, which they pushed before them. Everyone seemedhappy and contented and prosperous.The Guardian of the Gates led them through the streets until they came to a bigbuilding, exactly in the middle of the City, which was the Palace of Oz, theGreat Wizard. There was a soldier before the door, dressed in a green uniformand wearing a long green beard.“Here are strangers,” said the Guardian of the Gates to him,“and they demand to see the Great Oz.”“Step inside,” answered the soldier, “and I will carry yourmessage to him.”So they passed through the Palace Gates and were led into a big room with agreen carpet and lovely green furniture set with emeralds. The soldier madethem all wipe their feet upon a green mat before entering this room, and whenthey were seated he said politely:“Please make yourselves comfortable while I go to the door of the ThroneRoom and tell Oz you are here.”They had to wait a long time before the soldier returned. When, at last, hecame back, Dorothy asked:“Have you seen Oz?”“Oh, no,” returned the soldier; “I have never seen him. But Ispoke to him as he sat behind his screen and gave him your message. He said hewill grant you an audience, if you so desire; but each one of you must enterhis presence alone, and he will admit but one each day. Therefore, as you mustremain in the Palace for several days, I will have you shown to rooms where youmay rest in comfort after your journey.”“Thank you,” replied the girl; “that is very kind ofOz.”The soldier now blew upon a green whistle, and at once a young girl, dressed ina pretty green silk gown, entered the room. She had lovely green hair and greeneyes, and she bowed low before Dorothy as she said, “Follow me and I willshow you your room.”So Dorothy said good-bye to all her friends except Toto, and taking the dog inher arms followed the green girl through seven passages and up three flights ofstairs until they came to a room at the front of the Palace. It was thesweetest little room in the world, with a soft comfortable bed that had sheetsof green silk and a green velvet counterpane. There was a tiny fountain in themiddle of the room, that shot a spray of green perfume into the air, to fallback into a beautifully carved green marble basin. Beautiful green flowersstood in the windows, and there was a shelf with a row of little green books.When Dorothy had time to open these books she found them full of queer greenpictures that made her laugh, they were so funny.In a wardrobe were many green dresses, made of silk and satin and velvet; andall of them fitted Dorothy exactly.“Make yourself perfectly at home,” said the green girl, “andif you wish for anything ring the bell. Oz will send for you tomorrowmorning.”She left Dorothy alone and went back to the others. These she also led torooms, and each one of them found himself lodged in a very pleasant part of thePalace. Of course this politeness was wasted on the Scarecrow; for when hefound himself alone in his room he stood stupidly in one spot, just within thedoorway, to wait till morning. It would not rest him to lie down, and he couldnot close his eyes; so he remained all night staring at a little spider whichwas weaving its web in a corner of the room, just as if it were not one of themost wonderful rooms in the world. The Tin Woodman lay down on his bed fromforce of habit, for he remembered when he was made of flesh; but not being ableto sleep, he passed the night moving his joints up and down to make sure theykept in good working order. The Lion would have preferred a bed of dried leavesin the forest, and did not like being shut up in a room; but he had too muchsense to let this worry him, so he sprang upon the bed and rolled himself uplike a cat and purred himself asleep in a minute.The next morning, after breakfast, the green maiden came to fetch Dorothy, andshe dressed her in one of the prettiest gowns, made of green brocaded satin.Dorothy put on a green silk apron and tied a green ribbon around Toto’sneck, and they started for the Throne Room of the Great Oz.First they came to a great hall in which were many ladies and gentlemen of thecourt, all dressed in rich costumes. These people had nothing to do but talk toeach other, but they always came to wait outside the Throne Room every morning,although they were never permitted to see Oz. As Dorothy entered they looked ather curiously, and one of them whispered:“Are you really going to look upon the face of Oz the Terrible?”“Of course,” answered the girl, “if he will see me.”“Oh, he will see you,” said the soldier who had taken her messageto the Wizard, “although he does not like to have people ask to see him.Indeed, at first he was angry and said I should send you back where you camefrom. Then he asked me what you looked like, and when I mentioned your silvershoes he was very much interested. At last I told him about the mark upon yourforehead, and he decided he would admit you to his presence.”Just then a bell rang, and the green girl said to Dorothy, “That is thesignal. You must go into the Throne Room alone.”She opened a little door and Dorothy walked boldly through and found herself ina wonderful place. It was a big, round room with a high arched roof, and thewalls and ceiling and floor were covered with large emeralds set closelytogether. In the center of the roof was a great light, as bright as the sun,which made the emeralds sparkle in a wonderful manner.But what interested Dorothy most was the big throne of green marble that stoodin the middle of the room. It was shaped like a chair and sparkled with gems,as did everything else. In the center of the chair was an enormous Head,without a body to support it or any arms or legs whatever. There was no hairupon this head, but it had eyes and a nose and mouth, and was much bigger thanthe head of the biggest giant.As Dorothy gazed upon this in wonder and fear, the eyes turned slowly andlooked at her sharply and steadily. Then the mouth moved, and Dorothy heard avoice say:“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seekme?”It was not such an awful voice as she had expected to come from the big Head;so she took courage and answered:“I am Dorothy, the Small and Meek. I have come to you for help.”The eyes looked at her thoughtfully for a full minute. Then said the voice:“Where did you get the silver shoes?”“I got them from the Wicked Witch of the East, when my house fell on herand killed her,” she replied.“Where did you get the mark upon your forehead?” continued thevoice.“That is where the Good Witch of the North kissed me when she bade megood-bye and sent me to you,” said the girl.Again the eyes looked at her sharply, and they saw she was telling the truth.Then Oz asked, “What do you wish me to do?”“Send me back to Kansas, where my Aunt Em and Uncle Henry are,” sheanswered earnestly. “I don’t like your country, although it is sobeautiful. And I am sure Aunt Em will be dreadfully worried over my being awayso long.”The eyes winked three times, and then they turned up to the ceiling and down tothe floor and rolled around so queerly that they seemed to see every part ofthe room. And at last they looked at Dorothy again.“Why should I do this for you?” asked Oz.“Because you are strong and I am weak; because you are a Great Wizard andI am only a little girl.”“But you were strong enough to kill the Wicked Witch of the East,”said Oz.“That just happened,” returned Dorothy simply; “I could nothelp it.”“Well,” said the Head, “I will give you my answer. You haveno right to expect me to send you back to Kansas unless you do something for mein return. In this country everyone must pay for everything he gets. If youwish me to use my magic power to send you home again you must do something forme first. Help me and I will help you.”“What must I do?” asked the girl.“Kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” answered Oz.“But I cannot!” exclaimed Dorothy, greatly surprised.“You killed the Witch of the East and you wear the silver shoes, whichbear a powerful charm. There is now but one Wicked Witch left in all this land,and when you can tell me she is dead I will send you back to Kansas—butnot before.”The little girl began to weep, she was so much disappointed; and the eyeswinked again and looked upon her anxiously, as if the Great Oz felt that shecould help him if she would.“I never killed anything, willingly,” she sobbed. “Even if Iwanted to, how could I kill the Wicked Witch? If you, who are Great andTerrible, cannot kill her yourself, how do you expect me to do it?”“I do not know,” said the Head; “but that is my answer, anduntil the Wicked Witch dies you will not see your uncle and aunt again.Remember that the Witch is Wicked—tremendously Wicked—and ought tobe killed. Now go, and do not ask to see me again until you have done yourtask.”Sorrowfully Dorothy left the Throne Room and went back where the Lion and theScarecrow and the Tin Woodman were waiting to hear what Oz had said to her.“There is no hope for me,” she said sadly, “for Oz will notsend me home until I have killed the Wicked Witch of the West; and that I cannever do.”Her friends were sorry, but could do nothing to help her; so Dorothy went toher own room and lay down on the bed and cried herself to sleep.The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Scarecrow andsaid:“Come with me, for Oz has sent for you.”So the Scarecrow followed him and was admitted into the great Throne Room,where he saw, sitting in the emerald throne, a most lovely Lady. She wasdressed in green silk gauze and wore upon her flowing green locks a crown ofjewels. Growing from her shoulders were wings, gorgeous in color and so lightthat they fluttered if the slightest breath of air reached them.When the Scarecrow had bowed, as prettily as his straw stuffing would let him,before this beautiful creature, she looked upon him sweetly, and said:“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seekme?”Now the Scarecrow, who had expected to see the great Head Dorothy had told himof, was much astonished; but he answered her bravely.“I am only a Scarecrow, stuffed with straw. Therefore I have no brains,and I come to you praying that you will put brains in my head instead of straw,so that I may become as much a man as any other in your dominions.”“Why should I do this for you?” asked the Lady.“Because you are wise and powerful, and no one else can help me,”answered the Scarecrow.“I never grant favors without some return,” said Oz; “butthis much I will promise. If you will kill for me the Wicked Witch of the West,I will bestow upon you a great many brains, and such good brains that you willbe the wisest man in all the Land of Oz.”“I thought you asked Dorothy to kill the Witch,” said theScarecrow, in surprise.“So I did. I don’t care who kills her. But until she is dead I willnot grant your wish. Now go, and do not seek me again until you have earned thebrains you so greatly desire.”The Scarecrow went sorrowfully back to his friends and told them what Oz hadsaid; and Dorothy was surprised to find that the Great Wizard was not a Head,as she had seen him, but a lovely Lady.“All the same,” said the Scarecrow, “she needs a heart asmuch as the Tin Woodman.”On the next morning the soldier with the green whiskers came to the Tin Woodmanand said:“Oz has sent for you. Follow me.”So the Tin Woodman followed him and came to the great Throne Room. He did notknow whether he would find Oz a lovely Lady or a Head, but he hoped it would bethe lovely Lady. “For,” he said to himself, “if it is thehead, I am sure I shall not be given a heart, since a head has no heart of itsown and therefore cannot feel for me. But if it is the lovely Lady I shall beghard for a heart, for all ladies are themselves said to be kindlyhearted.”But when the Woodman entered the great Throne Room he saw neither the Head northe Lady, for Oz had taken the shape of a most terrible Beast. It was nearly asbig as an elephant, and the green throne seemed hardly strong enough to holdits weight. The Beast had a head like that of a rhinoceros, only there werefive eyes in its face. There were five long arms growing out of its body, andit also had five long, slim legs. Thick, woolly hair covered every part of it,and a more dreadful-looking monster could not be imagined. It was fortunate theTin Woodman had no heart at that moment, for it would have beat loud and fastfrom terror. But being only tin, the Woodman was not at all afraid, although hewas much disappointed.“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” spoke the Beast, in a voice thatwas one great roar. “Who are you, and why do you seek me?”“I am a Woodman, and made of tin. Therefore I have no heart, and cannotlove. I pray you to give me a heart that I may be as other men are.”“Why should I do this?” demanded the Beast.“Because I ask it, and you alone can grant my request,” answeredthe Woodman.Oz gave a low growl at this, but said, gruffly: “If you indeed desire aheart, you must earn it.”“How?” asked the Woodman.“Help Dorothy to kill the Wicked Witch of the West,” replied theBeast. “When the Witch is dead, come to me, and I will then give you thebiggest and kindest and most loving heart in all the Land of Oz.”So the Tin Woodman was forced to return sorrowfully to his friends and tellthem of the terrible Beast he had seen. They all wondered greatly at the manyforms the Great Wizard could take upon himself, and the Lion said:“If he is a Beast when I go to see him, I shall roar my loudest, and sofrighten him that he will grant all I ask. And if he is the lovely Lady, Ishall pretend to spring upon her, and so compel her to do my bidding. And if heis the great Head, he will be at my mercy; for I will roll this head all aboutthe room until he promises to give us what we desire. So be of good cheer, myfriends, for all will yet be well.”The next morning the soldier with the green whiskers led the Lion to the greatThrone Room and bade him enter the presence of Oz.The Lion at once passed through the door, and glancing around saw, to hissurprise, that before the throne was a Ball of Fire, so fierce and glowing hecould scarcely bear to gaze upon it. His first thought was that Oz had byaccident caught on fire and was burning up; but when he tried to go nearer, theheat was so intense that it singed his whiskers, and he crept back tremblinglyto a spot nearer the door.Then a low, quiet voice came from the Ball of Fire, and these were the words itspoke:“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Who are you, and why do you seekme?”And the Lion answered, “I am a Cowardly Lion, afraid of everything. Icame to you to beg that you give me courage, so that in reality I may becomethe King of Beasts, as men call me.”“Why should I give you courage?” demanded Oz.“Because of all Wizards you are the greatest, and alone have power togrant my request,” answered the Lion.The Ball of Fire burned fiercely for a time, and the voice said, “Bringme proof that the Wicked Witch is dead, and that moment I will give youcourage. But as long as the Witch lives, you must remain a coward.”The Lion was angry at this speech, but could say nothing in reply, and while hestood silently gazing at the Ball of Fire it became so furiously hot that heturned tail and rushed from the room. He was glad to find his friends waitingfor him, and told them of his terrible interview with the Wizard.“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy sadly.“There is only one thing we can do,” returned the Lion, “andthat is to go to the land of the Winkies, seek out the Wicked Witch, anddestroy her.”“But suppose we cannot?” said the girl.“Then I shall never have courage,” declared the Lion.“And I shall never have brains,” added the Scarecrow.“And I shall never have a heart,” spoke the Tin Woodman.“And I shall never see Aunt Em and Uncle Henry,” said Dorothy,beginning to cry.“Be careful!” cried the green girl. “The tears will fall onyour green silk gown and spot it.”So Dorothy dried her eyes and said, “I suppose we must try it; but I amsure I do not want to kill anybody, even to see Aunt Em again.”“I will go with you; but I’m too much of a coward to kill theWitch,” said the Lion.“I will go too,” declared the Scarecrow; “but I shall not beof much help to you, I am such a fool.”“I haven’t the heart to harm even a Witch,” remarked the TinWoodman; “but if you go I certainly shall go with you.”Therefore it was decided to start upon their journey the next morning, and theWoodman sharpened his axe on a green grindstone and had all his joints properlyoiled. The Scarecrow stuffed himself with fresh straw and Dorothy put new painton his eyes that he might see better. The green girl, who was very kind tothem, filled Dorothy’s basket with good things to eat, and fastened alittle bell around Toto’s neck with a green ribbon.They went to bed quite early and slept soundly until daylight, when they wereawakened by the crowing of a green cock that lived in the back yard of thePalace, and the cackling of a hen that had laid a green egg."

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Search for the Wicked Witch,"The soldier with the green whiskers led them through the streets of the EmeraldCity until they reached the room where the Guardian of the Gates lived. Thisofficer unlocked their spectacles to put them back in his great box, and thenhe politely opened the gate for our friends.“Which road leads to the Wicked Witch of the West?” asked Dorothy.“There is no road,” answered the Guardian of the Gates. “Noone ever wishes to go that way.”“How, then, are we to find her?” inquired the girl.“That will be easy,” replied the man, “for when she knows youare in the country of the Winkies she will find you, and make you all herslaves.”“Perhaps not,” said the Scarecrow, “for we mean to destroyher.”“Oh, that is different,” said the Guardian of the Gates. “Noone has ever destroyed her before, so I naturally thought she would make slavesof you, as she has of the rest. But take care; for she is wicked and fierce,and may not allow you to destroy her. Keep to the West, where the sun sets, andyou cannot fail to find her.”They thanked him and bade him good-bye, and turned toward the West, walkingover fields of soft grass dotted here and there with daisies and buttercups.Dorothy still wore the pretty silk dress she had put on in the palace, but now,to her surprise, she found it was no longer green, but pure white. The ribbonaround Toto’s neck had also lost its green color and was as white asDorothy’s dress.The Emerald City was soon left far behind. As they advanced the ground becamerougher and hillier, for there were no farms nor houses in this country of theWest, and the ground was untilled.In the afternoon the sun shone hot in their faces, for there were no trees tooffer them shade; so that before night Dorothy and Toto and the Lion weretired, and lay down upon the grass and fell asleep, with the Woodman and theScarecrow keeping watch.Now the Wicked Witch of the West had but one eye, yet that was as powerful as atelescope, and could see everywhere. So, as she sat in the door of her castle,she happened to look around and saw Dorothy lying asleep, with her friends allabout her. They were a long distance off, but the Wicked Witch was angry tofind them in her country; so she blew upon a silver whistle that hung aroundher neck.At once there came running to her from all directions a pack of great wolves.They had long legs and fierce eyes and sharp teeth.“Go to those people,” said the Witch, “and tear them topieces.”“Are you not going to make them your slaves?” asked the leader ofthe wolves.“No,” she answered, “one is of tin, and one of straw; one isa girl and another a Lion. None of them is fit to work, so you may tear theminto small pieces.”“Very well,” said the wolf, and he dashed away at full speed,followed by the others.It was lucky the Scarecrow and the Woodman were wide awake and heard the wolvescoming.“This is my fight,” said the Woodman, “so get behind me and Iwill meet them as they come.”He seized his axe, which he had made very sharp, and as the leader of thewolves came on the Tin Woodman swung his arm and chopped the wolf’s headfrom its body, so that it immediately died. As soon as he could raise his axeanother wolf came up, and he also fell under the sharp edge of the TinWoodman’s weapon. There were forty wolves, and forty times a wolf waskilled, so that at last they all lay dead in a heap before the Woodman.Then he put down his axe and sat beside the Scarecrow, who said, “It wasa good fight, friend.”They waited until Dorothy awoke the next morning. The little girl was quitefrightened when she saw the great pile of shaggy wolves, but the Tin Woodmantold her all. She thanked him for saving them and sat down to breakfast, afterwhich they started again upon their journey.Now this same morning the Wicked Witch came to the door of her castle andlooked out with her one eye that could see far off. She saw all her wolveslying dead, and the strangers still traveling through her country. This madeher angrier than before, and she blew her silver whistle twice.Straightway a great flock of wild crows came flying toward her, enough todarken the sky.And the Wicked Witch said to the King Crow, “Fly at once to thestrangers; peck out their eyes and tear them to pieces.”The wild crows flew in one great flock toward Dorothy and her companions. Whenthe little girl saw them coming she was afraid.But the Scarecrow said, “This is my battle, so lie down beside me and youwill not be harmed.”So they all lay upon the ground except the Scarecrow, and he stood up andstretched out his arms. And when the crows saw him they were frightened, asthese birds always are by scarecrows, and did not dare to come any nearer. Butthe King Crow said:“It is only a stuffed man. I will peck his eyes out.”The King Crow flew at the Scarecrow, who caught it by the head and twisted itsneck until it died. And then another crow flew at him, and the Scarecrowtwisted its neck also. There were forty crows, and forty times the Scarecrowtwisted a neck, until at last all were lying dead beside him. Then he called tohis companions to rise, and again they went upon their journey.When the Wicked Witch looked out again and saw all her crows lying in a heap,she got into a terrible rage, and blew three times upon her silver whistle.Forthwith there was heard a great buzzing in the air, and a swarm of black beescame flying toward her.“Go to the strangers and sting them to death!” commanded the Witch,and the bees turned and flew rapidly until they came to where Dorothy and herfriends were walking. But the Woodman had seen them coming, and the Scarecrowhad decided what to do.“Take out my straw and scatter it over the little girl and the dog andthe Lion,” he said to the Woodman, “and the bees cannot stingthem.” This the Woodman did, and as Dorothy lay close beside the Lion andheld Toto in her arms, the straw covered them entirely.The bees came and found no one but the Woodman to sting, so they flew at himand broke off all their stings against the tin, without hurting the Woodman atall. And as bees cannot live when their stings are broken that was the end ofthe black bees, and they lay scattered thick about the Woodman, like littleheaps of fine coal.Then Dorothy and the Lion got up, and the girl helped the Tin Woodman put thestraw back into the Scarecrow again, until he was as good as ever. So theystarted upon their journey once more.The Wicked Witch was so angry when she saw her black bees in little heaps likefine coal that she stamped her foot and tore her hair and gnashed her teeth.And then she called a dozen of her slaves, who were the Winkies, and gave themsharp spears, telling them to go to the strangers and destroy them.The Winkies were not a brave people, but they had to do as they were told. Sothey marched away until they came near to Dorothy. Then the Lion gave a greatroar and sprang towards them, and the poor Winkies were so frightened that theyran back as fast as they could.When they returned to the castle the Wicked Witch beat them well with a strap,and sent them back to their work, after which she sat down to think what sheshould do next. She could not understand how all her plans to destroy thesestrangers had failed; but she was a powerful Witch, as well as a wicked one,and she soon made up her mind how to act.There was, in her cupboard, a Golden Cap, with a circle of diamonds and rubiesrunning round it. This Golden Cap had a charm. Whoever owned it could callthree times upon the Winged Monkeys, who would obey any order they were given.But no person could command these strange creatures more than three times.Twice already the Wicked Witch had used the charm of the Cap. Once was when shehad made the Winkies her slaves, and set herself to rule over their country.The Winged Monkeys had helped her do this. The second time was when she hadfought against the Great Oz himself, and driven him out of the land of theWest. The Winged Monkeys had also helped her in doing this. Only once morecould she use this Golden Cap, for which reason she did not like to do so untilall her other powers were exhausted. But now that her fierce wolves and herwild crows and her stinging bees were gone, and her slaves had been scared awayby the Cowardly Lion, she saw there was only one way left to destroy Dorothyand her friends.So the Wicked Witch took the Golden Cap from her cupboard and placed it uponher head. Then she stood upon her left foot and said, slowly:“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!”Next she stood upon her right foot and said:“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!”After this she stood upon both feet and cried in a loud voice:“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!”Now the charm began to work. The sky was darkened, and a low rumbling sound washeard in the air. There was a rushing of many wings, a great chattering andlaughing, and the sun came out of the dark sky to show the Wicked Witchsurrounded by a crowd of monkeys, each with a pair of immense and powerfulwings on his shoulders.One, much bigger than the others, seemed to be their leader. He flew close tothe Witch and said, “You have called us for the third and last time. Whatdo you command?”“Go to the strangers who are within my land and destroy them all exceptthe Lion,” said the Wicked Witch. “Bring that beast to me, for Ihave a mind to harness him like a horse, and make him work.”“Your commands shall be obeyed,” said the leader. Then, with agreat deal of chattering and noise, the Winged Monkeys flew away to the placewhere Dorothy and her friends were walking.Some of the Monkeys seized the Tin Woodman and carried him through the airuntil they were over a country thickly covered with sharp rocks. Here theydropped the poor Woodman, who fell a great distance to the rocks, where he layso battered and dented that he could neither move nor groan.Others of the Monkeys caught the Scarecrow, and with their long fingers pulledall of the straw out of his clothes and head. They made his hat and boots andclothes into a small bundle and threw it into the top branches of a tall tree.The remaining Monkeys threw pieces of stout rope around the Lion and wound manycoils about his body and head and legs, until he was unable to bite or scratchor struggle in any way. Then they lifted him up and flew away with him to theWitch’s castle, where he was placed in a small yard with a high ironfence around it, so that he could not escape.But Dorothy they did not harm at all. She stood, with Toto in her arms,watching the sad fate of her comrades and thinking it would soon be her turn.The leader of the Winged Monkeys flew up to her, his long, hairy arms stretchedout and his ugly face grinning terribly; but he saw the mark of the GoodWitch’s kiss upon her forehead and stopped short, motioning the othersnot to touch her.“We dare not harm this little girl,” he said to them, “forshe is protected by the Power of Good, and that is greater than the Power ofEvil. All we can do is to carry her to the castle of the Wicked Witch and leaveher there.”So, carefully and gently, they lifted Dorothy in their arms and carried herswiftly through the air until they came to the castle, where they set her downupon the front doorstep. Then the leader said to the Witch:“We have obeyed you as far as we were able. The Tin Woodman and theScarecrow are destroyed, and the Lion is tied up in your yard. The little girlwe dare not harm, nor the dog she carries in her arms. Your power over our bandis now ended, and you will never see us again.”Then all the Winged Monkeys, with much laughing and chattering and noise, flewinto the air and were soon out of sight.The Wicked Witch was both surprised and worried when she saw the mark onDorothy’s forehead, for she knew well that neither the Winged Monkeys norshe, herself, dare hurt the girl in any way. She looked down at Dorothy’sfeet, and seeing the Silver Shoes, began to tremble with fear, for she knewwhat a powerful charm belonged to them. At first the Witch was tempted to runaway from Dorothy; but she happened to look into the child’s eyes and sawhow simple the soul behind them was, and that the little girl did not know ofthe wonderful power the Silver Shoes gave her. So the Wicked Witch laughed toherself, and thought, “I can still make her my slave, for she does notknow how to use her power.” Then she said to Dorothy, harshly andseverely:“Come with me; and see that you mind everything I tell you, for if you donot I will make an end of you, as I did of the Tin Woodman and theScarecrow.”Dorothy followed her through many of the beautiful rooms in her castle untilthey came to the kitchen, where the Witch bade her clean the pots and kettlesand sweep the floor and keep the fire fed with wood.Dorothy went to work meekly, with her mind made up to work as hard as shecould; for she was glad the Wicked Witch had decided not to kill her.With Dorothy hard at work, the Witch thought she would go into the courtyardand harness the Cowardly Lion like a horse; it would amuse her, she was sure,to make him draw her chariot whenever she wished to go to drive. But as sheopened the gate the Lion gave a loud roar and bounded at her so fiercely thatthe Witch was afraid, and ran out and shut the gate again.“If I cannot harness you,” said the Witch to the Lion, speakingthrough the bars of the gate, “I can starve you. You shall have nothingto eat until you do as I wish.”So after that she took no food to the imprisoned Lion; but every day she cameto the gate at noon and asked, “Are you ready to be harnessed like ahorse?”And the Lion would answer, “No. If you come in this yard, I will biteyou.”The reason the Lion did not have to do as the Witch wished was that everynight, while the woman was asleep, Dorothy carried him food from the cupboard.After he had eaten he would lie down on his bed of straw, and Dorothy would liebeside him and put her head on his soft, shaggy mane, while they talked oftheir troubles and tried to plan some way to escape. But they could find no wayto get out of the castle, for it was constantly guarded by the yellow Winkies,who were the slaves of the Wicked Witch and too afraid of her not to do as shetold them.The girl had to work hard during the day, and often the Witch threatened tobeat her with the same old umbrella she always carried in her hand. But, intruth, she did not dare to strike Dorothy, because of the mark upon herforehead. The child did not know this, and was full of fear for herself andToto. Once the Witch struck Toto a blow with her umbrella and the brave littledog flew at her and bit her leg in return. The Witch did not bleed where shewas bitten, for she was so wicked that the blood in her had dried up many yearsbefore.Dorothy’s life became very sad as she grew to understand that it would beharder than ever to get back to Kansas and Aunt Em again. Sometimes she wouldcry bitterly for hours, with Toto sitting at her feet and looking into herface, whining dismally to show how sorry he was for his little mistress. Totodid not really care whether he was in Kansas or the Land of Oz so long asDorothy was with him; but he knew the little girl was unhappy, and that madehim unhappy too.Now the Wicked Witch had a great longing to have for her own the Silver Shoeswhich the girl always wore. Her bees and her crows and her wolves were lying inheaps and drying up, and she had used up all the power of the Golden Cap; butif she could only get hold of the Silver Shoes, they would give her more powerthan all the other things she had lost. She watched Dorothy carefully, to seeif she ever took off her shoes, thinking she might steal them. But the childwas so proud of her pretty shoes that she never took them off except at nightand when she took her bath. The Witch was too much afraid of the dark to darego in Dorothy’s room at night to take the shoes, and her dread of waterwas greater than her fear of the dark, so she never came near when Dorothy wasbathing. Indeed, the old Witch never touched water, nor ever let water touchher in any way.But the wicked creature was very cunning, and she finally thought of a trickthat would give her what she wanted. She placed a bar of iron in the middle ofthe kitchen floor, and then by her magic arts made the iron invisible to humaneyes. So that when Dorothy walked across the floor she stumbled over the bar,not being able to see it, and fell at full length. She was not much hurt, butin her fall one of the Silver Shoes came off; and before she could reach it,the Witch had snatched it away and put it on her own skinny foot.The wicked woman was greatly pleased with the success of her trick, for as longas she had one of the shoes she owned half the power of their charm, andDorothy could not use it against her, even had she known how to do so.The little girl, seeing she had lost one of her pretty shoes, grew angry, andsaid to the Witch, “Give me back my shoe!”“I will not,” retorted the Witch, “for it is now my shoe, andnot yours.”“You are a wicked creature!” cried Dorothy. “You have noright to take my shoe from me.”“I shall keep it, just the same,” said the Witch, laughing at her,“and someday I shall get the other one from you, too.”This made Dorothy so very angry that she picked up the bucket of water thatstood near and dashed it over the Witch, wetting her from head to foot.Instantly the wicked woman gave a loud cry of fear, and then, as Dorothy lookedat her in wonder, the Witch began to shrink and fall away.“See what you have done!” she screamed. “In a minute I shallmelt away.”“I’m very sorry, indeed,” said Dorothy, who was trulyfrightened to see the Witch actually melting away like brown sugar before hervery eyes.“Didn’t you know water would be the end of me?” asked theWitch, in a wailing, despairing voice.“Of course not,” answered Dorothy. “How should I?”“Well, in a few minutes I shall be all melted, and you will have thecastle to yourself. I have been wicked in my day, but I never thought a littlegirl like you would ever be able to melt me and end my wicked deeds. Lookout—here I go!”With these words the Witch fell down in a brown, melted, shapeless mass andbegan to spread over the clean boards of the kitchen floor. Seeing that she hadreally melted away to nothing, Dorothy drew another bucket of water and threwit over the mess. She then swept it all out the door. After picking out thesilver shoe, which was all that was left of the old woman, she cleaned anddried it with a cloth, and put it on her foot again. Then, being at last freeto do as she chose, she ran out to the courtyard to tell the Lion that theWicked Witch of the West had come to an end, and that they were no longerprisoners in a strange land."

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,The Rescue,"The Cowardly Lion was much pleased to hear that the Wicked Witch had beenmelted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy at once unlocked the gate of hisprison and set him free. They went in together to the castle, whereDorothy’s first act was to call all the Winkies together and tell themthat they were no longer slaves.There was great rejoicing among the yellow Winkies, for they had been made towork hard during many years for the Wicked Witch, who had always treated themwith great cruelty. They kept this day as a holiday, then and ever after, andspent the time in feasting and dancing.“If our friends, the Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman, were only withus,” said the Lion, “I should be quite happy.”“Don’t you suppose we could rescue them?” asked the girlanxiously.“We can try,” answered the Lion.So they called the yellow Winkies and asked them if they would help to rescuetheir friends, and the Winkies said that they would be delighted to do all intheir power for Dorothy, who had set them free from bondage. So she chose anumber of the Winkies who looked as if they knew the most, and they all startedaway. They traveled that day and part of the next until they came to the rockyplain where the Tin Woodman lay, all battered and bent. His axe was near him,but the blade was rusted and the handle broken off short.The Winkies lifted him tenderly in their arms, and carried him back to theYellow Castle again, Dorothy shedding a few tears by the way at the sad plightof her old friend, and the Lion looking sober and sorry. When they reached thecastle Dorothy said to the Winkies:“Are any of your people tinsmiths?”“Oh, yes. Some of us are very good tinsmiths,” they told her.“Then bring them to me,” she said. And when the tinsmiths came,bringing with them all their tools in baskets, she inquired, “Can youstraighten out those dents in the Tin Woodman, and bend him back into shapeagain, and solder him together where he is broken?”The tinsmiths looked the Woodman over carefully and then answered that theythought they could mend him so he would be as good as ever. So they set to workin one of the big yellow rooms of the castle and worked for three days and fournights, hammering and twisting and bending and soldering and polishing andpounding at the legs and body and head of the Tin Woodman, until at last he wasstraightened out into his old form, and his joints worked as well as ever. Tobe sure, there were several patches on him, but the tinsmiths did a good job,and as the Woodman was not a vain man he did not mind the patches at all.When, at last, he walked into Dorothy’s room and thanked her for rescuinghim, he was so pleased that he wept tears of joy, and Dorothy had to wipe everytear carefully from his face with her apron, so his joints would not be rusted.At the same time her own tears fell thick and fast at the joy of meeting herold friend again, and these tears did not need to be wiped away. As for theLion, he wiped his eyes so often with the tip of his tail that it became quitewet, and he was obliged to go out into the courtyard and hold it in the suntill it dried.“If we only had the Scarecrow with us again,” said the Tin Woodman,when Dorothy had finished telling him everything that had happened, “Ishould be quite happy.”“We must try to find him,” said the girl.So she called the Winkies to help her, and they walked all that day and part ofthe next until they came to the tall tree in the branches of which the WingedMonkeys had tossed the Scarecrow’s clothes.It was a very tall tree, and the trunk was so smooth that no one could climbit; but the Woodman said at once, “I’ll chop it down, and then wecan get the Scarecrow’s clothes.”Now while the tinsmiths had been at work mending the Woodman himself, anotherof the Winkies, who was a goldsmith, had made an axe-handle of solid gold andfitted it to the Woodman’s axe, instead of the old broken handle. Otherspolished the blade until all the rust was removed and it glistened likeburnished silver.As soon as he had spoken, the Tin Woodman began to chop, and in a short timethe tree fell over with a crash, whereupon the Scarecrow’s clothes fellout of the branches and rolled off on the ground.Dorothy picked them up and had the Winkies carry them back to the castle, wherethey were stuffed with nice, clean straw; and behold! here was the Scarecrow,as good as ever, thanking them over and over again for saving him.Now that they were reunited, Dorothy and her friends spent a few happy days atthe Yellow Castle, where they found everything they needed to make themcomfortable.But one day the girl thought of Aunt Em, and said, “We must go back toOz, and claim his promise.”“Yes,” said the Woodman, “at last I shall get myheart.”“And I shall get my brains,” added the Scarecrow joyfully.“And I shall get my courage,” said the Lion thoughtfully.“And I shall get back to Kansas,” cried Dorothy, clapping herhands. “Oh, let us start for the Emerald City tomorrow!”This they decided to do. The next day they called the Winkies together and badethem good-bye. The Winkies were sorry to have them go, and they had grown sofond of the Tin Woodman that they begged him to stay and rule over them and theYellow Land of the West. Finding they were determined to go, the Winkies gaveToto and the Lion each a golden collar; and to Dorothy they presented abeautiful bracelet studded with diamonds; and to the Scarecrow they gave agold-headed walking stick, to keep him from stumbling; and to the Tin Woodmanthey offered a silver oil-can, inlaid with gold and set with precious jewels.Every one of the travelers made the Winkies a pretty speech in return, and allshook hands with them until their arms ached.Dorothy went to the Witch’s cupboard to fill her basket with food for thejourney, and there she saw the Golden Cap. She tried it on her own head andfound that it fitted her exactly. She did not know anything about the charm ofthe Golden Cap, but she saw that it was pretty, so she made up her mind to wearit and carry her sunbonnet in the basket.Then, being prepared for the journey, they all started for the Emerald City;and the Winkies gave them three cheers and many good wishes to carry with them."

When the four travelers wentin search of the Witch she had seen them coming, and so sent the Winged Monkeysto bring them to her. It was much harder to find their way back through the bigfields of buttercups and yellow daisies than it was being carried. They knew,of course, they must go straight east, toward the rising sun; and they startedoff in the right way. But at noon, when the sun was over their heads, they didnot know which was east and which was west, and that was the reason they werelost in the great fields. They kept on walking, however, and at night the mooncame out and shone brightly. So they lay down among the sweet smelling yellowflowers and slept soundly until morning—all but the Scarecrow and the TinWoodman.The next morning the sun was behind a cloud, but they started on, as if theywere quite sure which way they were going.“If we walk far enough,” said Dorothy, “I am sure we shallsometime come to some place.”But day by day passed away, and they still saw nothing before them but thescarlet fields. The Scarecrow began to grumble a bit.“We have surely lost our way,” he said, “and unless we findit again in time to reach the Emerald City, I shall never get my brains.”“Nor I my heart,” declared the Tin Woodman. “It seems to me Ican scarcely wait till I get to Oz, and you must admit this is a very longjourney.”“You see,” said the Cowardly Lion, with a whimper, “Ihaven’t the courage to keep tramping forever, without getting anywhere atall.”Then Dorothy lost heart. She sat down on the grass and looked at hercompanions, and they sat down and looked at her, and Toto found that for thefirst time in his life he was too tired to chase a butterfly that flew past hishead. So he put out his tongue and panted and looked at Dorothy as if to askwhat they should do next.“Suppose we call the field mice,” she suggested. “They couldprobably tell us the way to the Emerald City.”“To be sure they could,” cried the Scarecrow. “Whydidn’t we think of that before?”Dorothy blew the little whistle she had always carried about her neck since theQueen of the Mice had given it to her. In a few minutes they heard thepattering of tiny feet, and many of the small gray mice came running up to her.Among them was the Queen herself, who asked, in her squeaky little voice:“What can I do for my friends?”“We have lost our way,” said Dorothy. “Can you tell us wherethe Emerald City is?”“Certainly,” answered the Queen; “but it is a great way off,for you have had it at your backs all this time.” Then she noticedDorothy’s Golden Cap, and said, “Why don’t you use the charmof the Cap, and call the Winged Monkeys to you? They will carry you to the Cityof Oz in less than an hour.”“I didn’t know there was a charm,” answered Dorothy, insurprise. “What is it?”“It is written inside the Golden Cap,” replied the Queen of theMice. “But if you are going to call the Winged Monkeys we must run away,for they are full of mischief and think it great fun to plague us.”“Won’t they hurt me?” asked the girl anxiously.“Oh, no. They must obey the wearer of the Cap. Good-bye!” And shescampered out of sight, with all the mice hurrying after her.Dorothy looked inside the Golden Cap and saw some words written upon thelining. These, she thought, must be the charm, so she read the directionscarefully and put the Cap upon her head.“Ep-pe, pep-pe, kak-ke!” she said, standing on her left foot.“What did you say?” asked the Scarecrow, who did not know what shewas doing.“Hil-lo, hol-lo, hel-lo!” Dorothy went on, standing this time onher right foot.“Hello!” replied the Tin Woodman calmly.“Ziz-zy, zuz-zy, zik!” said Dorothy, who was now standing on bothfeet. This ended the saying of the charm, and they heard a great chattering andflapping of wings, as the band of Winged Monkeys flew up to them.The King bowed low before Dorothy, and asked, “What is yourcommand?”“We wish to go to the Emerald City,” said the child, “and wehave lost our way.”“We will carry you,” replied the King, and no sooner had he spokenthan two of the Monkeys caught Dorothy in their arms and flew away with her.Others took the Scarecrow and the Woodman and the Lion, and one little Monkeyseized Toto and flew after them, although the dog tried hard to bite him.The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman were rather frightened at first, for theyremembered how badly the Winged Monkeys had treated them before; but they sawthat no harm was intended, so they rode through the air quite cheerfully, andhad a fine time looking at the pretty gardens and woods far below them.Dorothy found herself riding easily between two of the biggest Monkeys, one ofthem the King himself. They had made a chair of their hands and were carefulnot to hurt her.“Why do you have to obey the charm of the Golden Cap?” she asked.“That is a long story,” answered the King, with a winged laugh;“but as we have a long journey before us, I will pass the time by tellingyou about it, if you wish.”“I shall be glad to hear it,” she replied.“Once,” began the leader, “we were a free people, livinghappily in the great forest, flying from tree to tree, eating nuts and fruit,and doing just as we pleased without calling anybody master. Perhaps some of uswere rather too full of mischief at times, flying down to pull the tails of theanimals that had no wings, chasing birds, and throwing nuts at the people whowalked in the forest. But we were careless and happy and full of fun, andenjoyed every minute of the day. This was many years ago, long before Oz cameout of the clouds to rule over this land.“There lived here then, away at the North, a beautiful princess, who wasalso a powerful sorceress. All her magic was used to help the people, and shewas never known to hurt anyone who was good. Her name was Gayelette, and shelived in a handsome palace built from great blocks of ruby. Everyone loved her,but her greatest sorrow was that she could find no one to love in return, sinceall the men were much too stupid and ugly to mate with one so beautiful andwise. At last, however, she found a boy who was handsome and manly and wisebeyond his years. Gayelette made up her mind that when he grew to be a man shewould make him her husband, so she took him to her ruby palace and used all hermagic powers to make him as strong and good and lovely as any woman could wish.When he grew to manhood, Quelala, as he was called, was said to be the best andwisest man in all the land, while his manly beauty was so great that Gayeletteloved him dearly, and hastened to make everything ready for the wedding.“My grandfather was at that time the King of the Winged Monkeys whichlived in the forest near Gayelette’s palace, and the old fellow loved ajoke better than a good dinner. One day, just before the wedding, mygrandfather was flying out with his band when he saw Quelala walking beside theriver. He was dressed in a rich costume of pink silk and purple velvet, and mygrandfather thought he would see what he could do. At his word the band flewdown and seized Quelala, carried him in their arms until they were over themiddle of the river, and then dropped him into the water.“‘Swim out, my fine fellow,’ cried my grandfather, ‘andsee if the water has spotted your clothes.’ Quelala was much too wise notto swim, and he was not in the least spoiled by all his good fortune. Helaughed, when he came to the top of the water, and swam in to shore. But whenGayelette came running out to him she found his silks and velvet all ruined bythe river.“The princess was angry, and she knew, of course, who did it. She had allthe Winged Monkeys brought before her, and she said at first that their wingsshould be tied and they should be treated as they had treated Quelala, anddropped in the river. But my grandfather pleaded hard, for he knew the Monkeyswould drown in the river with their wings tied, and Quelala said a kind wordfor them also; so that Gayelette finally spared them, on condition that theWinged Monkeys should ever after do three times the bidding of the owner of theGolden Cap. This Cap had been made for a wedding present to Quelala, and it issaid to have cost the princess half her kingdom. Of course my grandfather andall the other Monkeys at once agreed to the condition, and that is how ithappens that we are three times the slaves of the owner of the Golden Cap,whosoever he may be.”“And what became of them?” asked Dorothy, who had been greatlyinterested in the story.“Quelala being the first owner of the Golden Cap,” replied theMonkey, “he was the first to lay his wishes upon us. As his bride couldnot bear the sight of us, he called us all to him in the forest after he hadmarried her and ordered us always to keep where she could never again set eyeson a Winged Monkey, which we were glad to do, for we were all afraid of her.“This was all we ever had to do until the Golden Cap fell into the handsof the Wicked Witch of the West, who made us enslave the Winkies, and afterwarddrive Oz himself out of the Land of the West. Now the Golden Cap is yours, andthree times you have the right to lay your wishes upon us.”As the Monkey King finished his story Dorothy looked down and saw the green,shining walls of the Emerald City before them. She wondered at the rapid flightof the Monkeys, but was glad the journey was over. The strange creatures setthe travelers down carefully before the gate of the City, the King bowed low toDorothy, and then flew swiftly away, followed by all his band.“That was a good ride,” said the little girl.“Yes, and a quick way out of our troubles,” replied the Lion.“How lucky it was you brought away that wonderful Cap!”"

After ringing several times, it was opened by the same Guardian of theGates they had met before.“What! are you back again?” he asked, in surprise.“Do you not see us?” answered the Scarecrow.“But I thought you had gone to visit the Wicked Witch of the West.”“We did visit her,” said the Scarecrow.“And she let you go again?” asked the man, in wonder.“She could not help it, for she is melted,” explained theScarecrow.“Melted! Well, that is good news, indeed,” said the man. “Whomelted her?”“It was Dorothy,” said the Lion gravely.“Good gracious!” exclaimed the man, and he bowed very low indeedbefore her.Then he led them into his little room and locked the spectacles from the greatbox on all their eyes, just as he had done before. Afterward they passed onthrough the gate into the Emerald City. When the people heard from the Guardianof the Gates that Dorothy had melted the Wicked Witch of the West, they allgathered around the travelers and followed them in a great crowd to the Palaceof Oz.The soldier with the green whiskers was still on guard before the door, but helet them in at once, and they were again met by the beautiful green girl, whoshowed each of them to their old rooms at once, so they might rest until theGreat Oz was ready to receive them.The soldier had the news carried straight to Oz that Dorothy and the othertravelers had come back again, after destroying the Wicked Witch; but Oz madeno reply. They thought the Great Wizard would send for them at once, but he didnot. They had no word from him the next day, nor the next, nor the next. Thewaiting was tiresome and wearing, and at last they grew vexed that Oz shouldtreat them in so poor a fashion, after sending them to undergo hardships andslavery. So the Scarecrow at last asked the green girl to take another messageto Oz, saying if he did not let them in to see him at once they would call theWinged Monkeys to help them, and find out whether he kept his promises or not.When the Wizard was given this message he was so frightened that he sent wordfor them to come to the Throne Room at four minutes after nine o’clockthe next morning. He had once met the Winged Monkeys in the Land of the West,and he did not wish to meet them again.The four travelers passed a sleepless night, each thinking of the gift Oz hadpromised to bestow on him. Dorothy fell asleep only once, and then she dreamedshe was in Kansas, where Aunt Em was telling her how glad she was to have herlittle girl at home again.Promptly at nine o’clock the next morning the green-whiskered soldiercame to them, and four minutes later they all went into the Throne Room of theGreat Oz.Of course each one of them expected to see the Wizard in the shape he had takenbefore, and all were greatly surprised when they looked about and saw no one atall in the room. They kept close to the door and closer to one another, for thestillness of the empty room was more dreadful than any of the forms they hadseen Oz take.Presently they heard a solemn Voice, that seemed to come from somewhere nearthe top of the great dome, and it said:“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible. Why do you seek me?”They looked again in every part of the room, and then, seeing no one, Dorothyasked, “Where are you?”“I am everywhere,” answered the Voice, “but to the eyes ofcommon mortals I am invisible. I will now seat myself upon my throne, that youmay converse with me.” Indeed, the Voice seemed just then to comestraight from the throne itself; so they walked toward it and stood in a rowwhile Dorothy said:“We have come to claim our promise, O Oz.”“What promise?” asked Oz.“You promised to send me back to Kansas when the Wicked Witch wasdestroyed,” said the girl.“And you promised to give me brains,” said the Scarecrow.“And you promised to give me a heart,” said the Tin Woodman.“And you promised to give me courage,” said the Cowardly Lion.“Is the Wicked Witch really destroyed?” asked the Voice, andDorothy thought it trembled a little.“Yes,” she answered, “I melted her with a bucket ofwater.”“Dear me,” said the Voice, “how sudden! Well, come to metomorrow, for I must have time to think it over.”“You’ve had plenty of time already,” said the Tin Woodmanangrily.“We shan’t wait a day longer,” said the Scarecrow.“You must keep your promises to us!” exclaimed Dorothy.The Lion thought it might be as well to frighten the Wizard, so he gave alarge, loud roar, which was so fierce and dreadful that Toto jumped away fromhim in alarm and tipped over the screen that stood in a corner. As it fell witha crash they looked that way, and the next moment all of them were filled withwonder. For they saw, standing in just the spot the screen had hidden, a littleold man, with a bald head and a wrinkled face, who seemed to be as muchsurprised as they were. The Tin Woodman, raising his axe, rushed toward thelittle man and cried out, “Who are you?”“I am Oz, the Great and Terrible,” said the little man, in atrembling voice. “But don’t strike me—pleasedon’t—and I’ll do anything you want me to.”Our friends looked at him in surprise and dismay.“I thought Oz was a great Head,” said Dorothy.“And I thought Oz was a lovely Lady,” said the Scarecrow.“And I thought Oz was a terrible Beast,” said the Tin Woodman.“And I thought Oz was a Ball of Fire,” exclaimed the Lion.“No, you are all wrong,” said the little man meekly. “I havebeen making believe.”“Making believe!” cried Dorothy. “Are you not a GreatWizard?”“Hush, my dear,” he said. “Don’t speak so loud, or youwill be overheard—and I should be ruined. I’m supposed to be aGreat Wizard.”“And aren’t you?” she asked.“Not a bit of it, my dear; I’m just a common man.”“You’re more than that,” said the Scarecrow, in a grievedtone; “you’re a humbug.”“Exactly so!” declared the little man, rubbing his hands togetheras if it pleased him. “I am a humbug.”“But this is terrible,” said the Tin Woodman. “How shall Iever get my heart?”“Or I my courage?” asked the Lion.“Or I my brains?” wailed the Scarecrow, wiping the tears from hiseyes with his coat sleeve.“My dear friends,” said Oz, “I pray you not to speak of theselittle things. Think of me, and the terrible trouble I’m in at beingfound out.”“Doesn’t anyone else know you’re a humbug?” askedDorothy.“No one knows it but you four—and myself,” replied Oz.“I have fooled everyone so long that I thought I should never be foundout. It was a great mistake my ever letting you into the Throne Room. Usually Iwill not see even my subjects, and so they believe I am somethingterrible.”“But, I don’t understand,” said Dorothy, in bewilderment.“How was it that you appeared to me as a great Head?”“That was one of my tricks,” answered Oz. “Step this way,please, and I will tell you all about it.”He led the way to a small chamber in the rear of the Throne Room, and they allfollowed him. He pointed to one corner, in which lay the great Head, made outof many thicknesses of paper, and with a carefully painted face.“This I hung from the ceiling by a wire,” said Oz. “I stoodbehind the screen and pulled a thread, to make the eyes move and the mouthopen.”“But how about the voice?” she inquired.“Oh, I am a ventriloquist,” said the little man. “I can throwthe sound of my voice wherever I wish, so that you thought it was coming out ofthe Head. Here are the other things I used to deceive you.” He showed theScarecrow the dress and the mask he had worn when he seemed to be the lovelyLady. And the Tin Woodman saw that his terrible Beast was nothing but a lot ofskins, sewn together, with slats to keep their sides out. As for the Ball ofFire, the false Wizard had hung that also from the ceiling. It was really aball of cotton, but when oil was poured upon it the ball burned fiercely.“Really,” said the Scarecrow, “you ought to be ashamed ofyourself for being such a humbug.”“I am—I certainly am,” answered the little man sorrowfully;“but it was the only thing I could do. Sit down, please, there are plentyof chairs; and I will tell you my story.”So they sat down and listened while he told the following tale.“I was born in Omaha—”“Why, that isn’t very far from Kansas!” cried Dorothy.“No, but it’s farther from here,” he said, shaking his headat her sadly. “When I grew up I became a ventriloquist, and at that I wasvery well trained by a great master. I can imitate any kind of a bird orbeast.” Here he mewed so like a kitten that Toto pricked up his ears andlooked everywhere to see where she was. “After a time,” continuedOz, “I tired of that, and became a balloonist.”“What is that?” asked Dorothy.“A man who goes up in a balloon on circus day, so as to draw a crowd ofpeople together and get them to pay to see the circus,” he explained.“Oh,” she said, “I know.”“Well, one day I went up in a balloon and the ropes got twisted, so thatI couldn’t come down again. It went way up above the clouds, so far thata current of air struck it and carried it many, many miles away. For a day anda night I traveled through the air, and on the morning of the second day Iawoke and found the balloon floating over a strange and beautiful country.“It came down gradually, and I was not hurt a bit. But I found myself inthe midst of a strange people, who, seeing me come from the clouds, thought Iwas a great Wizard. Of course I let them think so, because they were afraid ofme, and promised to do anything I wished them to.“Just to amuse myself, and keep the good people busy, I ordered them tobuild this City, and my Palace; and they did it all willingly and well. Then Ithought, as the country was so green and beautiful, I would call it the EmeraldCity; and to make the name fit better I put green spectacles on all the people,so that everything they saw was green.”“But isn’t everything here green?” asked Dorothy.“No more than in any other city,” replied Oz; “but when youwear green spectacles, why of course everything you see looks green to you. TheEmerald City was built a great many years ago, for I was a young man when theballoon brought me here, and I am a very old man now. But my people have worngreen glasses on their eyes so long that most of them think it really is anEmerald City, and it certainly is a beautiful place, abounding in jewels andprecious metals, and every good thing that is needed to make one happy. I havebeen good to the people, and they like me; but ever since this Palace wasbuilt, I have shut myself up and would not see any of them.“One of my greatest fears was the Witches, for while I had no magicalpowers at all I soon found out that the Witches were really able to dowonderful things. There were four of them in this country, and they ruled thepeople who live in the North and South and East and West. Fortunately, theWitches of the North and South were good, and I knew they would do me no harm;but the Witches of the East and West were terribly wicked, and had they notthought I was more powerful than they themselves, they would surely havedestroyed me. As it was, I lived in deadly fear of them for many years; so youcan imagine how pleased I was when I heard your house had fallen on the WickedWitch of the East. When you came to me, I was willing to promise anything ifyou would only do away with the other Witch; but, now that you have melted her,I am ashamed to say that I cannot keep my promises.”“I think you are a very bad man,” said Dorothy.“Oh, no, my dear; I’m really a very good man, but I’m a verybad Wizard, I must admit.”“Can’t you give me brains?” asked the Scarecrow.“You don’t need them. You are learning something every day. A babyhas brains, but it doesn’t know much. Experience is the only thing thatbrings knowledge, and the longer you are on earth the more experience you aresure to get.”“That may all be true,” said the Scarecrow, “but I shall bevery unhappy unless you give me brains.”The false Wizard looked at him carefully.“Well,” he said with a sigh, “I’m not much of amagician, as I said; but if you will come to me tomorrow morning, I will stuffyour head with brains. I cannot tell you how to use them, however; you mustfind that out for yourself.”“Oh, thank you—thank you!” cried the Scarecrow.“I’ll find a way to use them, never fear!”“But how about my courage?” asked the Lion anxiously.“You have plenty of courage, I am sure,” answered Oz. “Allyou need is confidence in yourself. There is no living thing that is not afraidwhen it faces danger. The True courage is in facing danger when you are afraid,and that kind of courage you have in plenty.”“Perhaps I have, but I’m scared just the same,” said theLion. “I shall really be very unhappy unless you give me the sort ofcourage that makes one forget he is afraid.”“Very well, I will give you that sort of courage tomorrow,” repliedOz.“How about my heart?” asked the Tin Woodman.“Why, as for that,” answered Oz, “I think you are wrong towant a heart. It makes most people unhappy. If you only knew it, you are inluck not to have a heart.”“That must be a matter of opinion,” said the Tin Woodman.“For my part, I will bear all the unhappiness without a murmur, if youwill give me the heart.”“Very well,” answered Oz meekly. “Come to me tomorrow and youshall have a heart. I have played Wizard for so many years that I may as wellcontinue the part a little longer.”“And now,” said Dorothy, “how am I to get back toKansas?”“We shall have to think about that,” replied the little man.“Give me two or three days to consider the matter and I’ll try tofind a way to carry you over the desert. In the meantime you shall all betreated as my guests, and while you live in the Palace my people will wait uponyou and obey your slightest wish. There is only one thing I ask in return formy help—such as it is. You must keep my secret and tell no one I am ahumbug.”They agreed to say nothing of what they had learned, and went back to theirrooms in high spirits. Even Dorothy had hope that “The Great and TerribleHumbug,” as she called him, would find a way to send her back to Kansas,and if he did she was willing to forgive him everything."

I am going to Oz to get my brains at last. When Ireturn I shall be as other men are.”“I have always liked you as you were,” said Dorothy simply.“It is kind of you to like a Scarecrow,” he replied. “Butsurely you will think more of me when you hear the splendid thoughts my newbrain is going to turn out.” Then he said good-bye to them all in acheerful voice and went to the Throne Room, where he rapped upon the door.“Come in,” said Oz.The Scarecrow went in and found the little man sitting down by the window,engaged in deep thought.“I have come for my brains,” remarked the Scarecrow, a littleuneasily.“Oh, yes; sit down in that chair, please,” replied Oz. “Youmust excuse me for taking your head off, but I shall have to do it in order toput your brains in their proper place.”“That’s all right,” said the Scarecrow. “You are quitewelcome to take my head off, as long as it will be a better one when you put iton again.”So the Wizard unfastened his head and emptied out the straw. Then he enteredthe back room and took up a measure of bran, which he mixed with a great manypins and needles. Having shaken them together thoroughly, he filled the top ofthe Scarecrow’s head with the mixture and stuffed the rest of the spacewith straw, to hold it in place.When he had fastened the Scarecrow’s head on his body again he said tohim, “Hereafter you will be a great man, for I have given you a lot ofbran-new brains.”The Scarecrow was both pleased and proud at the fulfillment of his greatestwish, and having thanked Oz warmly he went back to his friends.Dorothy looked at him curiously. His head was quite bulged out at the top withbrains.“How do you feel?” she asked.“I feel wise indeed,” he answered earnestly. “When I get usedto my brains I shall know everything.”“Why are those needles and pins sticking out of your head?” askedthe Tin Woodman.“That is proof that he is sharp,” remarked the Lion.“Well, I must go to Oz and get my heart,” said the Woodman. So hewalked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.“Come in,” called Oz, and the Woodman entered and said, “Ihave come for my heart.”“Very well,” answered the little man. “But I shall have tocut a hole in your breast, so I can put your heart in the right place. I hopeit won’t hurt you.”“Oh, no,” answered the Woodman. “I shall not feel it atall.”So Oz brought a pair of tinsmith’s shears and cut a small, square hole inthe left side of the Tin Woodman’s breast. Then, going to a chest ofdrawers, he took out a pretty heart, made entirely of silk and stuffed withsawdust.“Isn’t it a beauty?” he asked.“It is, indeed!” replied the Woodman, who was greatly pleased.“But is it a kind heart?”“Oh, very!” answered Oz. He put the heart in the Woodman’sbreast and then replaced the square of tin, soldering it neatly together whereit had been cut.“There,” said he; “now you have a heart that any man might beproud of. I’m sorry I had to put a patch on your breast, but it reallycouldn’t be helped.”“Never mind the patch,” exclaimed the happy Woodman. “I amvery grateful to you, and shall never forget your kindness.”“Don’t speak of it,” replied Oz.Then the Tin Woodman went back to his friends, who wished him every joy onaccount of his good fortune.The Lion now walked to the Throne Room and knocked at the door.“Come in,” said Oz.“I have come for my courage,” announced the Lion, entering theroom.“Very well,” answered the little man; “I will get it foryou.”He went to a cupboard and reaching up to a high shelf took down a square greenbottle, the contents of which he poured into a green-gold dish, beautifullycarved. Placing this before the Cowardly Lion, who sniffed at it as if he didnot like it, the Wizard said:“Drink.”“What is it?” asked the Lion.“Well,” answered Oz, “if it were inside of you, it would becourage. You know, of course, that courage is always inside one; so that thisreally cannot be called courage until you have swallowed it. Therefore I adviseyou to drink it as soon as possible.”The Lion hesitated no longer, but drank till the dish was empty.“How do you feel now?” asked Oz.“Full of courage,” replied the Lion, who went joyfully back to hisfriends to tell them of his good fortune.Oz, left to himself, smiled to think of his success in giving the Scarecrow andthe Tin Woodman and the Lion exactly what they thought they wanted. “Howcan I help being a humbug,” he said, “when all these people make medo things that everybody knows can’t be done? It was easy to make theScarecrow and the Lion and the Woodman happy, because they imagined I could doanything. But it will take more than imagination to carry Dorothy back toKansas, and I’m sure I don’t know how it can be done.”"

These were sad days for thelittle girl, although her friends were all quite happy and contented. TheScarecrow told them there were wonderful thoughts in his head; but he would notsay what they were because he knew no one could understand them but himself.When the Tin Woodman walked about he felt his heart rattling around in hisbreast; and he told Dorothy he had discovered it to be a kinder and more tenderheart than the one he had owned when he was made of flesh. The Lion declared hewas afraid of nothing on earth, and would gladly face an army or a dozen of thefierce Kalidahs.Thus each of the little party was satisfied except Dorothy, who longed morethan ever to get back to Kansas.On the fourth day, to her great joy, Oz sent for her, and when she entered theThrone Room he greeted her pleasantly:“Sit down, my dear; I think I have found the way to get you out of thiscountry.”“And back to Kansas?” she asked eagerly.“Well, I’m not sure about Kansas,” said Oz, “for Ihaven’t the faintest notion which way it lies. But the first thing to dois to cross the desert, and then it should be easy to find your wayhome.”“How can I cross the desert?” she inquired.“Well, I’ll tell you what I think,” said the little man.“You see, when I came to this country it was in a balloon. You also camethrough the air, being carried by a cyclone. So I believe the best way to getacross the desert will be through the air. Now, it is quite beyond my powers tomake a cyclone; but I’ve been thinking the matter over, and I believe Ican make a balloon.”“How?” asked Dorothy.“A balloon,” said Oz, “is made of silk, which is coated withglue to keep the gas in it. I have plenty of silk in the Palace, so it will beno trouble to make the balloon. But in all this country there is no gas to fillthe balloon with, to make it float.”“If it won’t float,” remarked Dorothy, “it will be ofno use to us.”“True,” answered Oz. “But there is another way to make itfloat, which is to fill it with hot air. Hot air isn’t as good as gas,for if the air should get cold the balloon would come down in the desert, andwe should be lost.”“We!” exclaimed the girl. “Are you going with me?”“Yes, of course,” replied Oz. “I am tired of being such ahumbug. If I should go out of this Palace my people would soon discover I amnot a Wizard, and then they would be vexed with me for having deceived them. SoI have to stay shut up in these rooms all day, and it gets tiresome. I’dmuch rather go back to Kansas with you and be in a circus again.”“I shall be glad to have your company,” said Dorothy.“Thank you,” he answered. “Now, if you will help me sew thesilk together, we will begin to work on our balloon.”So Dorothy took a needle and thread, and as fast as Oz cut the strips of silkinto proper shape the girl sewed them neatly together. First there was a stripof light green silk, then a strip of dark green and then a strip of emeraldgreen; for Oz had a fancy to make the balloon in different shades of the colorabout them. It took three days to sew all the strips together, but when it wasfinished they had a big bag of green silk more than twenty feet long.Then Oz painted it on the inside with a coat of thin glue, to make it airtight,after which he announced that the balloon was ready.“But we must have a basket to ride in,” he said. So he sent thesoldier with the green whiskers for a big clothes basket, which he fastenedwith many ropes to the bottom of the balloon.When it was all ready, Oz sent word to his people that he was going to make avisit to a great brother Wizard who lived in the clouds. The news spreadrapidly throughout the city and everyone came to see the wonderful sight.Oz ordered the balloon carried out in front of the Palace, and the people gazedupon it with much curiosity. The Tin Woodman had chopped a big pile of wood,and now he made a fire of it, and Oz held the bottom of the balloon over thefire so that the hot air that arose from it would be caught in the silken bag.Gradually the balloon swelled out and rose into the air, until finally thebasket just touched the ground.Then Oz got into the basket and said to all the people in a loud voice:“I am now going away to make a visit. While I am gone the Scarecrow willrule over you. I command you to obey him as you would me.”The balloon was by this time tugging hard at the rope that held it to theground, for the air within it was hot, and this made it so much lighter inweight than the air without that it pulled hard to rise into the sky.“Come, Dorothy!” cried the Wizard. “Hurry up, or the balloonwill fly away.”“I can’t find Toto anywhere,” replied Dorothy, who did notwish to leave her little dog behind. Toto had run into the crowd to bark at akitten, and Dorothy at last found him. She picked him up and ran towards theballoon.She was within a few steps of it, and Oz was holding out his hands to help herinto the basket, when, crack! went the ropes, and the balloon rose into the airwithout her.“Come back!” she screamed. “I want to go, too!”“I can’t come back, my dear,” called Oz from the basket.“Good-bye!”“Good-bye!” shouted everyone, and all eyes were turned upward towhere the Wizard was riding in the basket, rising every moment farther andfarther into the sky.And that was the last any of them ever saw of Oz, the Wonderful Wizard, thoughhe may have reached Omaha safely, and be there now, for all we know. But thepeople remembered him lovingly, and said to one another:“Oz was always our friend. When he was here he built for us thisbeautiful Emerald City, and now he is gone he has left the Wise Scarecrow torule over us.”Still, for many days they grieved over the loss of the Wonderful Wizard, andwould not be comforted."

",物語の中心は、カンザス草原に住む少女ドロシーが、サイクロンによって魔法の国オズへと連れ去られてしまう,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/55/images/cover.jpg,Away to the South,"Dorothy wept bitterly at the passing of her hope to get home to Kansas again;but when she thought it all over she was glad she had not gone up in a balloon.And she also felt sorry at losing Oz, and so did her companions.The Tin Woodman came to her and said:“Truly I should be ungrateful if I failed to mourn for the man who gaveme my lovely heart. I should like to cry a little because Oz is gone, if youwill kindly wipe away my tears, so that I shall not rust.”“With pleasure,” she answered, and brought a towel at once. Thenthe Tin Woodman wept for several minutes, and she watched the tears carefullyand wiped them away with the towel. When he had finished, he thanked her kindlyand oiled himself thoroughly with his jeweled oil-can, to guard against mishap.The Scarecrow was now the ruler of the Emerald City, and although he was not aWizard the people were proud of him. “For,” they said, “thereis not another city in all the world that is ruled by a stuffed man.”And, so far as they knew, they were quite right.The morning after the balloon had gone up with Oz, the four travelers met inthe Throne Room and talked matters over. The Scarecrow sat in the big throneand the others stood respectfully before him.“We are not so unlucky,” said the new ruler, “for this Palaceand the Emerald City belong to us, and we can do just as we please. When Iremember that a short time ago I was up on a pole in a farmer’scornfield, and that now I am the ruler of this beautiful City, I am quitesatisfied with my lot.”“I also,” said the Tin Woodman, “am well-pleased with my newheart; and, really, that was the only thing I wished in all the world.”“For my part, I am content in knowing I am as brave as any beast thatever lived, if not braver,” said the Lion modestly.“If Dorothy would only be contented to live in the Emerald City,”continued the Scarecrow, “we might all be happy together.”“But I don’t want to live here,” cried Dorothy. “I wantto go to Kansas, and live with Aunt Em and Uncle Henry.”“Well, then, what can be done?” inquired the Woodman.The Scarecrow decided to think, and he thought so hard that the pins andneedles began to stick out of his brains. Finally he said:“Why not call the Winged Monkeys, and ask them to carry you over thedesert?”“I never thought of that!” said Dorothy joyfully. “It’sjust the thing. I’ll go at once for the Golden Cap.”When she brought it into the Throne Room she spoke the magic words, and soonthe band of Winged Monkeys flew in through the open window and stood besideher.“This is the second time you have called us,” said the Monkey King,bowing before the little girl. “What do you wish?”“I want you to fly with me to Kansas,” said Dorothy.But the Monkey King shook his head.“That cannot be done,” he said. “We belong to this countryalone, and cannot leave it. There has never been a Winged Monkey in Kansas yet,and I suppose there never will be, for they don’t belong there. We shallbe glad to serve you in any way in our power, but we cannot cross the desert.Good-bye.”And with another bow, the Monkey King spread his wings and flew away throughthe window, followed by all his band.Dorothy was ready to cry with disappointment. “I have wasted the charm ofthe Golden Cap to no purpose,” she said, “for the Winged Monkeyscannot help me.”“It is certainly too bad!” said the tender-hearted Woodman.The Scarecrow was thinking again, and his head bulged out so horribly thatDorothy feared it would burst.“Let us call in the soldier with the green whiskers,” he said,“and ask his advice.”So the soldier was summoned and entered the Throne Room timidly, for while Ozwas alive he never was allowed to come farther than the door.“This little girl,” said the Scarecrow to the soldier,“wishes to cross the desert. How can she do so?”“I cannot tell,” answered the soldier, “for nobody has evercrossed the desert, unless it is Oz himself.”“Is there no one who can help me?” asked Dorothy earnestly.“Glinda might,” he suggested.“Who is Glinda?” inquired the Scarecrow.“The Witch of the South. She is the most powerful of all the Witches, andrules over the Quadlings. Besides, her castle stands on the edge of the desert,so she may know a way to cross it.”“Glinda is a Good Witch, isn’t she?” asked the child.“The Quadlings think she is good,” said the soldier, “and sheis kind to everyone. I have heard that Glinda is a beautiful woman, who knowshow to keep young in spite of the many years she has lived.”“How can I get to her castle?” asked Dorothy.“The road is straight to the South,” he answered, “but it issaid to be full of dangers to travelers. There are wild beasts in the woods,and a race of queer men who do not like strangers to cross their country. Forthis reason none of the Quadlings ever come to the Emerald City.”The soldier then left them and the Scarecrow said:“It seems, in spite of dangers, that the best thing Dorothy can do is totravel to the Land of the South and ask Glinda to help her. For, of course, ifDorothy stays here she will never get back to Kansas.”“You must have been thinking again,” remarked the Tin Woodman.“I have,” said the Scarecrow.“I shall go with Dorothy,” declared the Lion, “for I am tiredof your city and long for the woods and the country again. I am really a wildbeast, you know. Besides, Dorothy will need someone to protect her.”“That is true,” agreed the Woodman. “My axe may be of serviceto her; so I also will go with her to the Land of the South.”“When shall we start?” asked the Scarecrow.“Are you going?” they asked, in surprise.“Certainly. If it wasn’t for Dorothy I should never have hadbrains. She lifted me from the pole in the cornfield and brought me to theEmerald City. So my good luck is all due to her, and I shall never leave heruntil she starts back to Kansas for good and all.”“Thank you,” said Dorothy gratefully. “You are all very kindto me. But I should like to start as soon as possible.”“We shall go tomorrow morning,” returned the Scarecrow. “Sonow let us all get ready, for it will be a long journey.”"

When the Guardian of the Gate saw them again he wonderedgreatly that they could leave the beautiful City to get into new trouble. Buthe at once unlocked their spectacles, which he put back into the green box, andgave them many good wishes to carry with them.“You are now our ruler,” he said to the Scarecrow; “so youmust come back to us as soon as possible.”“I certainly shall if I am able,” the Scarecrow replied; “butI must help Dorothy to get home, first.”As Dorothy bade the good-natured Guardian a last farewell she said:“I have been very kindly treated in your lovely City, and everyone hasbeen good to me. I cannot tell you how grateful I am.”“Don’t try, my dear,” he answered. “We should like tokeep you with us, but if it is your wish to return to Kansas, I hope you willfind a way.” He then opened the gate of the outer wall, and they walkedforth and started upon their journey.The sun shone brightly as our friends turned their faces toward the Land of theSouth. They were all in the best of spirits, and laughed and chatted together.Dorothy was once more filled with the hope of getting home, and the Scarecrowand the Tin Woodman were glad to be of use to her. As for the Lion, he sniffedthe fresh air with delight and whisked his tail from side to side in pure joyat being in the country again, while Toto ran around them and chased the mothsand butterflies, barking merrily all the time.“City life does not agree with me at all,” remarked the Lion, asthey walked along at a brisk pace. “I have lost much flesh since I livedthere, and now I am anxious for a chance to show the other beasts howcourageous I have grown.”They now turned and took a last look at the Emerald City. All they could seewas a mass of towers and steeples behind the green walls, and high up aboveeverything the spires and dome of the Palace of Oz.“Oz was not such a bad Wizard, after all,” said the Tin Woodman, ashe felt his heart rattling around in his breast.“He knew how to give me brains, and very good brains, too,” saidthe Scarecrow.“If Oz had taken a dose of the same courage he gave me,” added theLion, “he would have been a brave man.”Dorothy said nothing. Oz had not kept the promise he made her, but he had donehis best, so she forgave him. As he said, he was a good man, even if he was abad Wizard.The first day’s journey was through the green fields and bright flowersthat stretched about the Emerald City on every side. They slept that night onthe grass, with nothing but the stars over them; and they rested very wellindeed.In the morning they traveled on until they came to a thick wood. There was noway of going around it, for it seemed to extend to the right and left as far asthey could see; and, besides, they did not dare change the direction of theirjourney for fear of getting lost. So they looked for the place where it wouldbe easiest to get into the forest.The Scarecrow, who was in the lead, finally discovered a big tree with suchwide-spreading branches that there was room for the party to pass underneath.So he walked forward to the tree, but just as he came under the first branchesthey bent down and twined around him, and the next minute he was raised fromthe ground and flung headlong among his fellow travelers.This did not hurt the Scarecrow, but it surprised him, and he looked ratherdizzy when Dorothy picked him up.“Here is another space between the trees,” called the Lion.“Let me try it first,” said the Scarecrow, “for itdoesn’t hurt me to get thrown about.” He walked up to another tree,as he spoke, but its branches immediately seized him and tossed him back again.“This is strange,” exclaimed Dorothy. “What shall wedo?”“The trees seem to have made up their minds to fight us, and stop ourjourney,” remarked the Lion.“I believe I will try it myself,” said the Woodman, and shoulderinghis axe, he marched up to the first tree that had handled the Scarecrow soroughly. When a big branch bent down to seize him the Woodman chopped at it sofiercely that he cut it in two. At once the tree began shaking all its branchesas if in pain, and the Tin Woodman passed safely under it.“Come on!” he shouted to the others. “Be quick!” Theyall ran forward and passed under the tree without injury, except Toto, who wascaught by a small branch and shaken until he howled. But the Woodman promptlychopped off the branch and set the little dog free.The other trees of the forest did nothing to keep them back, so they made uptheir minds that only the first row of trees could bend down their branches,and that probably these were the policemen of the forest, and given thiswonderful power in order to keep strangers out of it.The four travelers walked with ease through the trees until they came to thefarther edge of the wood. Then, to their surprise, they found before them ahigh wall which seemed to be made of white china. It was smooth, like thesurface of a dish, and higher than their heads.“What shall we do now?” asked Dorothy.“I will make a ladder,” said the Tin Woodman, “for wecertainly must climb over the wall.”"

The Lion alsocurled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.The Scarecrow watched the Woodman while he worked, and said to him:“I cannot think why this wall is here, nor what it is made of.”“Rest your brains and do not worry about the wall,” replied theWoodman. “When we have climbed over it, we shall know what is on theother side.”After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman wassure it was strong and would answer their purpose. The Scarecrow waked Dorothyand the Lion and Toto, and told them that the ladder was ready. The Scarecrowclimbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to followclose behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his head over the topof the wall the Scarecrow said, “Oh, my!”“Go on,” exclaimed Dorothy.So the Scarecrow climbed farther up and sat down on the top of the wall, andDorothy put her head over and cried, “Oh, my!” just as theScarecrow had done.Then Toto came up, and immediately began to bark, but Dorothy made him bestill.The Lion climbed the ladder next, and the Tin Woodman came last; but both ofthem cried, “Oh, my!” as soon as they looked over the wall. Whenthey were all sitting in a row on the top of the wall, they looked down and sawa strange sight.Before them was a great stretch of country having a floor as smooth and shiningand white as the bottom of a big platter. Scattered around were many housesmade entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses werequite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy’swaist. There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; andmany cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, werestanding about in groups.But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. Therewere milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and goldenspots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silverand gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink andyellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; andprinces with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satindoublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon theircheeks and tall, pointed caps. And, strangest of all, these people were allmade of china, even to their clothes, and were so small that the tallest ofthem was no higher than Dorothy’s knee.No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purplechina dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at themin a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.“How shall we get down?” asked Dorothy.They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow felloff the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor wouldnot hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his head and getthe pins in their feet. When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow,whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.“We must cross this strange place in order to get to the otherside,” said Dorothy, “for it would be unwise for us to go any otherway except due South.”They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thingthey came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, thecow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even themilkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter.Dorothy was shocked to see that the cow had broken her leg off, and that thepail was lying in several small pieces, while the poor milkmaid had a nick inher left elbow.“There!” cried the milkmaid angrily. “See what you have done!My cow has broken her leg, and I must take her to the mender’s shop andhave it glued on again. What do you mean by coming here and frightening mycow?”“I’m very sorry,” returned Dorothy. “Please forgiveus.”But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She picked upthe leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. Asshe left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder atthe clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.Dorothy was quite grieved at this mishap.“We must be very careful here,” said the kind-hearted Woodman,“or we may hurt these pretty little people so they will never get overit.”A little farther on Dorothy met a most beautifully dressed young Princess, whostopped short as she saw the strangers and started to run away.Dorothy wanted to see more of the Princess, so she ran after her. But the chinagirl cried out:“Don’t chase me! Don’t chase me!”She had such a frightened little voice that Dorothy stopped and said,“Why not?”“Because,” answered the Princess, also stopping, a safe distanceaway, “if I run I may fall down and break myself.”“But could you not be mended?” asked the girl.“Oh, yes; but one is never so pretty after being mended, you know,”replied the Princess.“I suppose not,” said Dorothy.“Now there is Mr. Joker, one of our clowns,” continued the chinalady, “who is always trying to stand upon his head. He has broken himselfso often that he is mended in a hundred places, and doesn’t look at allpretty. Here he comes now, so you can see for yourself.”Indeed, a jolly little clown came walking toward them, and Dorothy could seethat in spite of his pretty clothes of red and yellow and green he wascompletely covered with cracks, running every which way and showing plainlythat he had been mended in many places.The Clown put his hands in his pockets, and after puffing out his cheeks andnodding his head at them saucily, he said:“My lady fair,Why do you stareAt poor old Mr. Joker?You’re quite as stiffAnd prim as ifYou’d eaten up a poker!”“Be quiet, sir!” said the Princess. “Can’t you seethese are strangers, and should be treated with respect?”“Well, that’s respect, I expect,” declared the Clown, andimmediately stood upon his head.“Don’t mind Mr. Joker,” said the Princess to Dorothy.“He is considerably cracked in his head, and that makes himfoolish.”“Oh, I don’t mind him a bit,” said Dorothy. “But youare so beautiful,” she continued, “that I am sure I could love youdearly. Won’t you let me carry you back to Kansas, and stand you on AuntEm’s mantel? I could carry you in my basket.”“That would make me very unhappy,” answered the china Princess.“You see, here in our country we live contentedly, and can talk and movearound as we please. But whenever any of us are taken away our joints at oncestiffen, and we can only stand straight and look pretty. Of course that is allthat is expected of us when we are on mantels and cabinets and drawing-roomtables, but our lives are much pleasanter here in our own country.”“I would not make you unhappy for all the world!” exclaimedDorothy. “So I’ll just say good-bye.”“Good-bye,” replied the Princess.They walked carefully through the china country. The little animals and all thepeople scampered out of their way, fearing the strangers would break them, andafter an hour or so the travelers reached the other side of the country andcame to another china wall.It was not so high as the first, however, and by standing upon the Lion’sback they all managed to scramble to the top. Then the Lion gathered his legsunder him and jumped on the wall; but just as he jumped, he upset a chinachurch with his tail and smashed it all to pieces.“That was too bad,” said Dorothy, “but really I think we werelucky in not doing these little people more harm than breaking a cow’sleg and a church. They are all so brittle!”“They are, indeed,” said the Scarecrow, “and I am thankful Iam made of straw and cannot be easily damaged. There are worse things in theworld than being a Scarecrow.”"

It was difficult to walk without falling into muddy holes, for the grasswas so thick that it hid them from sight. However, by carefully picking theirway, they got safely along until they reached solid ground. But here thecountry seemed wilder than ever, and after a long and tiresome walk through theunderbrush they entered another forest, where the trees were bigger and olderthan any they had ever seen.“This forest is perfectly delightful,” declared the Lion, lookingaround him with joy. “Never have I seen a more beautiful place.”“It seems gloomy,” said the Scarecrow.“Not a bit of it,” answered the Lion. “I should like to livehere all my life. See how soft the dried leaves are under your feet and howrich and green the moss is that clings to these old trees. Surely no wild beastcould wish a pleasanter home.”“Perhaps there are wild beasts in the forest now,” said Dorothy.“I suppose there are,” returned the Lion, “but I do not seeany of them about.”They walked through the forest until it became too dark to go any farther.Dorothy and Toto and the Lion lay down to sleep, while the Woodman and theScarecrow kept watch over them as usual.When morning came, they started again. Before they had gone far they heard alow rumble, as of the growling of many wild animals. Toto whimpered a little,but none of the others was frightened, and they kept along the well-troddenpath until they came to an opening in the wood, in which were gathered hundredsof beasts of every variety. There were tigers and elephants and bears andwolves and foxes and all the others in the natural history, and for a momentDorothy was afraid. But the Lion explained that the animals were holding ameeting, and he judged by their snarling and growling that they were in greattrouble.As he spoke several of the beasts caught sight of him, and at once the greatassemblage hushed as if by magic. The biggest of the tigers came up to the Lionand bowed, saying:“Welcome, O King of Beasts! You have come in good time to fight our enemyand bring peace to all the animals of the forest once more.”“What is your trouble?” asked the Lion quietly.“We are all threatened,” answered the tiger, “by a fierceenemy which has lately come into this forest. It is a most tremendous monster,like a great spider, with a body as big as an elephant and legs as long as atree trunk. It has eight of these long legs, and as the monster crawls throughthe forest he seizes an animal with a leg and drags it to his mouth, where heeats it as a spider does a fly. Not one of us is safe while this fiercecreature is alive, and we had called a meeting to decide how to take care ofourselves when you came among us.”The Lion thought for a moment.“Are there any other lions in this forest?” he asked.“No; there were some, but the monster has eaten them all. And, besides,they were none of them nearly so large and brave as you.”“If I put an end to your enemy, will you bow down to me and obey me asKing of the Forest?” inquired the Lion.“We will do that gladly,” returned the tiger; and all the otherbeasts roared with a mighty roar: “We will!”“Where is this great spider of yours now?” asked the Lion.“Yonder, among the oak trees,” said the tiger, pointing with hisforefoot.“Take good care of these friends of mine,” said the Lion,“and I will go at once to fight the monster.”He bade his comrades good-bye and marched proudly away to do battle with theenemy.The great spider was lying asleep when the Lion found him, and it looked sougly that its foe turned up his nose in disgust. Its legs were quite as long asthe tiger had said, and its body covered with coarse black hair. It had a greatmouth, with a row of sharp teeth a foot long; but its head was joined to thepudgy body by a neck as slender as a wasp’s waist. This gave the Lion ahint of the best way to attack the creature, and as he knew it was easier tofight it asleep than awake, he gave a great spring and landed directly upon themonster’s back. Then, with one blow of his heavy paw, all armed withsharp claws, he knocked the spider’s head from its body. Jumping down, hewatched it until the long legs stopped wiggling, when he knew it was quitedead.The Lion went back to the opening where the beasts of the forest were waitingfor him and said proudly:“You need fear your enemy no longer.”Then the beasts bowed down to the Lion as their King, and he promised to comeback and rule over them as soon as Dorothy was safely on her way to Kansas."

They had nearly reached the firstrock when they heard a rough voice cry out, “Keep back!”“Who are you?” asked the Scarecrow.Then a head showed itself over the rock and the same voice said, “Thishill belongs to us, and we don’t allow anyone to cross it.”“But we must cross it,” said the Scarecrow. “We’regoing to the country of the Quadlings.”“But you shall not!” replied the voice, and there stepped frombehind the rock the strangest man the travelers had ever seen.He was quite short and stout and had a big head, which was flat at the top andsupported by a thick neck full of wrinkles. But he had no arms at all, and,seeing this, the Scarecrow did not fear that so helpless a creature couldprevent them from climbing the hill. So he said, “I’m sorry not todo as you wish, but we must pass over your hill whether you like it ornot,” and he walked boldly forward.As quick as lightning the man’s head shot forward and his neck stretchedout until the top of the head, where it was flat, struck the Scarecrow in themiddle and sent him tumbling, over and over, down the hill. Almost as quicklyas it came the head went back to the body, and the man laughed harshly as hesaid, “It isn’t as easy as you think!”A chorus of boisterous laughter came from the other rocks, and Dorothy sawhundreds of the armless Hammer-Heads upon the hillside, one behind every rock.The Lion became quite angry at the laughter caused by the Scarecrow’smishap, and giving a loud roar that echoed like thunder, he dashed up the hill.Again a head shot swiftly out, and the great Lion went rolling down the hill asif he had been struck by a cannon ball.Dorothy ran down and helped the Scarecrow to his feet, and the Lion came up toher, feeling rather bruised and sore, and said, “It is useless to fightpeople with shooting heads; no one can withstand them.”“What can we do, then?” she asked.“Call the Winged Monkeys,” suggested the Tin Woodman. “Youhave still the right to command them once more.”“Very well,” she answered, and putting on the Golden Cap sheuttered the magic words. The Monkeys were as prompt as ever, and in a fewmoments the entire band stood before her.“What are your commands?” inquired the King of the Monkeys, bowinglow.“Carry us over the hill to the country of the Quadlings,” answeredthe girl.“It shall be done,” said the King, and at once the Winged Monkeyscaught the four travelers and Toto up in their arms and flew away with them. Asthey passed over the hill the Hammer-Heads yelled with vexation, and shot theirheads high in the air, but they could not reach the Winged Monkeys, whichcarried Dorothy and her comrades safely over the hill and set them down in thebeautiful country of the Quadlings.“This is the last time you can summon us,” said the leader toDorothy; “so good-bye and good luck to you.”“Good-bye, and thank you very much,” returned the girl; and theMonkeys rose into the air and were out of sight in a twinkling.The country of the Quadlings seemed rich and happy. There was field upon fieldof ripening grain, with well-paved roads running between, and pretty ripplingbrooks with strong bridges across them. The fences and houses and bridges wereall painted bright red, just as they had been painted yellow in the country ofthe Winkies and blue in the country of the Munchkins. The Quadlings themselves,who were short and fat and looked chubby and good-natured, were dressed all inred, which showed bright against the green grass and the yellowing grain.The Monkeys had set them down near a farmhouse, and the four travelers walkedup to it and knocked at the door. It was opened by the farmer’s wife, andwhen Dorothy asked for something to eat the woman gave them all a good dinner,with three kinds of cake and four kinds of cookies, and a bowl of milk forToto.“How far is it to the Castle of Glinda?” asked the child.“It is not a great way,” answered the farmer’s wife.“Take the road to the South and you will soon reach it.”Thanking the good woman, they started afresh and walked by the fields andacross the pretty bridges until they saw before them a very beautiful Castle.Before the gates were three young girls, dressed in handsome red uniformstrimmed with gold braid; and as Dorothy approached, one of them said to her:“Why have you come to the South Country?”“To see the Good Witch who rules here,” she answered. “Willyou take me to her?”“Let me have your name, and I will ask Glinda if she will receiveyou.” They told who they were, and the girl soldier went into the Castle.After a few moments she came back to say that Dorothy and the others were to beadmitted at once."

Her hair was a rich red incolor and fell in flowing ringlets over her shoulders. Her dress was pure whitebut her eyes were blue, and they looked kindly upon the little girl.“What can I do for you, my child?” she asked.Dorothy told the Witch all her story: how the cyclone had brought her to theLand of Oz, how she had found her companions, and of the wonderful adventuresthey had met with.“My greatest wish now,” she added, “is to get back to Kansas,for Aunt Em will surely think something dreadful has happened to me, and thatwill make her put on mourning; and unless the crops are better this year thanthey were last, I am sure Uncle Henry cannot afford it.”Glinda leaned forward and kissed the sweet, upturned face of the loving littlegirl.“Bless your dear heart,” she said, “I am sure I can tell youof a way to get back to Kansas.” Then she added, “But, if I do, youmust give me the Golden Cap.”“Willingly!” exclaimed Dorothy; “indeed, it is of no use tome now, and when you have it you can command the Winged Monkeys threetimes.”“And I think I shall need their service just those three times,”answered Glinda, smiling.Dorothy then gave her the Golden Cap, and the Witch said to the Scarecrow,“What will you do when Dorothy has left us?”“I will return to the Emerald City,” he replied, “for Oz hasmade me its ruler and the people like me. The only thing that worries me is howto cross the hill of the Hammer-Heads.”“By means of the Golden Cap I shall command the Winged Monkeys to carryyou to the gates of the Emerald City,” said Glinda, “for it wouldbe a shame to deprive the people of so wonderful a ruler.”“Am I really wonderful?” asked the Scarecrow.“You are unusual,” replied Glinda.Turning to the Tin Woodman, she asked, “What will become of you whenDorothy leaves this country?”He leaned on his axe and thought a moment. Then he said, “The Winkieswere very kind to me, and wanted me to rule over them after the Wicked Witchdied. I am fond of the Winkies, and if I could get back again to the Country ofthe West, I should like nothing better than to rule over them forever.”“My second command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda “willbe that they carry you safely to the land of the Winkies. Your brain may not beso large to look at as those of the Scarecrow, but you are really brighter thanhe is—when you are well polished—and I am sure you will rule theWinkies wisely and well.”Then the Witch looked at the big, shaggy Lion and asked, “When Dorothyhas returned to her own home, what will become of you?”“Over the hill of the Hammer-Heads,” he answered, “lies agrand old forest, and all the beasts that live there have made me their King.If I could only get back to this forest, I would pass my life very happilythere.”“My third command to the Winged Monkeys,” said Glinda, “shallbe to carry you to your forest. Then, having used up the powers of the GoldenCap, I shall give it to the King of the Monkeys, that he and his band maythereafter be free for evermore.”The Scarecrow and the Tin Woodman and the Lion now thanked the Good Witchearnestly for her kindness; and Dorothy exclaimed:“You are certainly as good as you are beautiful! But you have not yettold me how to get back to Kansas.”“Your Silver Shoes will carry you over the desert,” replied Glinda.“If you had known their power you could have gone back to your Aunt Emthe very first day you came to this country.”“But then I should not have had my wonderful brains!” cried theScarecrow. “I might have passed my whole life in the farmer’scornfield.”“And I should not have had my lovely heart,” said the Tin Woodman.“I might have stood and rusted in the forest till the end of theworld.”“And I should have lived a coward forever,” declared the Lion,“and no beast in all the forest would have had a good word to say tome.”“This is all true,” said Dorothy, “and I am glad I was of useto these good friends. But now that each of them has had what he most desired,and each is happy in having a kingdom to rule besides, I think I should like togo back to Kansas.”“The Silver Shoes,” said the Good Witch, “have wonderfulpowers. And one of the most curious things about them is that they can carryyou to any place in the world in three steps, and each step will be made in thewink of an eye. All you have to do is to knock the heels together three timesand command the shoes to carry you wherever you wish to go.”“If that is so,” said the child joyfully, “I will ask them tocarry me back to Kansas at once.”She threw her arms around the Lion’s neck and kissed him, patting his bighead tenderly. Then she kissed the Tin Woodman, who was weeping in a way mostdangerous to his joints. But she hugged the soft, stuffed body of the Scarecrowin her arms instead of kissing his painted face, and found she was cryingherself at this sorrowful parting from her loving comrades.Glinda the Good stepped down from her ruby throne to give the little girl agood-bye kiss, and Dorothy thanked her for all the kindness she had shown toher friends and herself.Dorothy now took Toto up solemnly in her arms, and having said one lastgood-bye she clapped the heels of her shoes together three times, saying:“Take me home to Aunt Em!”Instantly she was whirling through the air, so swiftly that all she could seeor feel was the wind whistling past her ears.The Silver Shoes took but three steps, and then she stopped so suddenly thatshe rolled over upon the grass several times before she knew where she was.At length, however, she sat up and looked about her.“Good gracious!” she cried.For she was sitting on the broad Kansas prairie, and just before her was thenew farmhouse Uncle Henry built after the cyclone had carried away the old one.Uncle Henry was milking the cows in the barnyard, and Toto had jumped out ofher arms and was running toward the barn, barking furiously.Dorothy stood up and found she was in her stocking-feet. For the Silver Shoeshad fallen off in her flight through the air, and were lost forever in thedesert."
