Itwas true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thinlight hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face wasyellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in oneway or another. Her father had held a position under the EnglishGovernment and had always been busy and ill himself, and her mother hadbeen a great beauty who cared only to go to parties and amuse herselfwith gay people. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Marywas born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made tounderstand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib she must keep thechild out of sight as much as possible. So when she was a sickly,fretful, ugly little baby she was kept out of the way, and when shebecame a sickly, fretful, toddling thing she was kept out of the wayalso. She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark facesof her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed herand gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would beangry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six yearsold she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived. Theyoung English governess who came to teach her to read and write dislikedher so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when othergovernesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shortertime than the first one. So if Mary had not chosen to really want toknow how to read books she would never have learned her letters at all.One frightfully hot morning, when she was about nine years old, sheawakened feeling very cross, and she became crosser still when she sawthat the servant who stood by her bedside was not her Ayah.""Why did you come?"" she said to the strange woman. ""I will not let youstay. Send my Ayah to me.""The woman looked frightened, but she only stammered that the Ayah couldnot come and when Mary threw herself into a passion and beat and kickedher, she looked only more frightened and repeated that it was notpossible for the Ayah to come to Missie Sahib.There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was donein its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing,while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scaredfaces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. Shewas actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wanderedout into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near theveranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuckbig scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the timegrowing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things shewould say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.""Pig! Pig! Daughter of Pigs!"" she said, because to call a native a pigis the worst insult of all.She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when sheheard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with afair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices.Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard thathe was a very young officer who had just come from England. The childstared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did thiswhen she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib—Mary used tocall her that oftener than anything else—was such a tall, slim, prettyperson and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk andshe had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, andshe had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, andMary said they were ""full of lace."" They looked fuller of lace than everthis morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large andscared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.""Is it so very bad? Oh, is it?"" Mary heard her say.""Awfully,"" the young man answered in a trembling voice. ""Awfully, Mrs.Lennox. You ought to have gone to the hills two weeks ago.""The Mem Sahib wrung her hands.""Oh, I know I ought!"" she cried. ""I only stayed to go to that sillydinner party. What a fool I was!""At that very moment such a loud sound of wailing broke out from theservants' quarters that she clutched the young man's arm, and Mary stoodshivering from head to foot. The wailing grew wilder and wilder.""What is it? What is it?"" Mrs. Lennox gasped.""Some one has died,"" answered the boy officer. ""You did not say it hadbroken out among your servants.""""I did not know!"" the Mem Sahib cried. ""Come with me! Come with me!"" andshe turned and ran into the house.After that appalling things happened, and the mysteriousness of themorning was explained to Mary. The cholera had broken out in its mostfatal form and people were dying like flies. The Ayah had been taken illin the night, and it was because she had just died that the servants hadwailed in the huts. Before the next day three other servants were deadand others had run away in terror. There was panic on every side, anddying people in all the bungalows.During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herselfin the nursery and was forgotten by every one. Nobody thought of her,nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knewnothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She onlyknew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and frighteningsounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though apartly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked asif they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly forsome reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirstyshe drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, andshe did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intenselydrowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again,frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound offeet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyesopen and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.Many things happened during the hours in which she slept so heavily, butshe was not disturbed by the wails and the sound of things being carriedin and out of the bungalow.When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house wasperfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. Sheheard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had gotwell of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also whowould take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah,and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tiredof the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was notan affectionate child and had never cared much for any one. The noiseand hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, andshe had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive.Every one was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one wasfond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they rememberednothing but themselves. But if every one had got well again, surely someone would remember and come to look for her.But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow moreand more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and whenshe looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching herwith eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmlesslittle thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get outof the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.""How queer and quiet it is,"" she said. ""It sounds as if there was no onein the bungalow but me and the snake.""Almost the next minute she heard footsteps in the compound, and then onthe veranda. They were men's footsteps, and the men entered the bungalowand talked in low voices. No one went to meet or speak to them and theyseemed to open doors and look into rooms.""What desolation!"" she heard one voice say. ""That pretty, pretty woman!I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one eversaw her.""Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the doora few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and wasfrowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefullyneglected. The first man who came in was a large officer she had onceseen talking to her father. He looked tired and troubled, but when hesaw her he was so startled that he almost jumped back.""Barney!"" he cried out. ""There is a child here! A child alone! In aplace like this! Mercy on us, who is she!""""I am Mary Lennox,"" the little girl said, drawing herself up stiffly.She thought the man was very rude to call her father's bungalow ""A placelike this!"" ""I fell asleep when every one had the cholera and I haveonly just wakened up. Why does nobody come?""""It is the child no one ever saw!"" exclaimed the man, turning to hiscompanions. ""She has actually been forgotten!""""Why was I forgotten?"" Mary said, stamping her foot. ""Why does nobodycome?""The young man whose name was Barney looked at her very sadly. Mary eventhought she saw him wink his eyes as if to wink tears away.""Poor little kid!"" he said. ""There is nobody left to come.""It was in that strange and sudden way that Mary found out that she hadneither father nor mother left; that they had died and been carried awayin the night, and that the few native servants who had not died also hadleft the house as quickly as they could get out of it, none of them evenremembering that there was a Missie Sahib. That was why the place was soquiet. It was true that there was no one in the bungalow but herself andthe little rustling snake."

She did not miss her at all, in fact, and as she was aself-absorbed child she gave her entire thought to herself, as she hadalways done. If she had been older she would no doubt have been veryanxious at being left alone in the world, but she was very young, and asshe had always been taken care of, she supposed she always would be.What she thought was that she would like to know if she was going tonice people, who would be polite to her and give her her own way as herAyah and the other native servants had done.She knew that she was not going to stay at the English clergyman's housewhere she was taken at first. She did not want to stay. The Englishclergyman was poor and he had five children nearly all the same age andthey wore shabby clothes and were always quarreling and snatching toysfrom each other. Mary hated their untidy bungalow and was sodisagreeable to them that after the first day or two nobody would playwith her. By the second day they had given her a nickname which made herfurious.It was Basil who thought of it first. Basil was a little boy withimpudent blue eyes and a turned-up nose and Mary hated him. She wasplaying by herself under a tree, just as she had been playing the daythe cholera broke out. She was making heaps of earth and paths for agarden and Basil came and stood near to watch her. Presently he gotrather interested and suddenly made a suggestion.""Why don't you put a heap of stones there and pretend it is a rockery?""he said. ""There in the middle,"" and he leaned over her to point.""Go away!"" cried Mary. ""I don't want boys. Go away!""For a moment Basil looked angry, and then he began to tease. He wasalways teasing his sisters. He danced round and round her and made facesand sang and laughed.He sang it until the other children heard and laughed, too; and thecrosser Mary got, the more they sang ""Mistress Mary, quite contrary"";and after that as long as she stayed with them they called her ""MistressMary Quite Contrary"" when they spoke of her to each other, and oftenwhen they spoke to her.""You are going to be sent home,"" Basil said to her, ""at the end of theweek. And we're glad of it.""""I am glad of it, too,"" answered Mary. ""Where is home?""""She doesn't know where home is!"" said Basil, with seven-year-old scorn.""It's England, of course. Our grandmama lives there and our sister Mabelwas sent to her last year. You are not going to your grandmama. You havenone. You are going to your uncle. His name is Mr. Archibald Craven.""""I don't know anything about him,"" snapped Mary.""I know you don't,"" Basil answered. ""You don't know anything. Girlsnever do. I heard father and mother talking about him. He lives in agreat, big, desolate old house in the country and no one goes near him.He's so cross he won't let them, and they wouldn't come if he would letthem. He's a hunchback, and he's horrid.""""I don't believe you,"" said Mary; and she turned her back and stuck herfingers in her ears, because she would not listen any more.But she thought over it a great deal afterward; and when Mrs. Crawfordtold her that night that she was going to sail away to England in a fewdays and go to her uncle, Mr. Archibald Craven, who lived atMisselthwaite Manor, she looked so stony and stubbornly uninterestedthat they did not know what to think about her. They tried to be kind toher, but she only turned her face away when Mrs. Crawford attempted tokiss her, and held herself stiffly when Mr. Crawford patted hershoulder.""She is such a plain child,"" Mrs. Crawford said pityingly, afterward.""And her mother was such a pretty creature. She had a very prettymanner, too, and Mary has the most unattractive ways I ever saw in achild. The children call her 'Mistress Mary Quite Contrary,' and thoughit's naughty of them, one can't help understanding it.""""Perhaps if her mother had carried her pretty face and her prettymanners oftener into the nursery Mary might have learned some prettyways too. It is very sad, now the poor beautiful thing is gone, toremember that many people never even knew that she had a child at all.""""I believe she scarcely ever looked at her,"" sighed Mrs. Crawford.""When her Ayah was dead there was no one to give a thought to the littlething. Think of the servants running away and leaving her all alone inthat deserted bungalow. Colonel McGrew said he nearly jumped out of hisskin when he opened the door and found her standing by herself in themiddle of the room.""Mary made the long voyage to England under the care of an officer'swife, who was taking her children to leave them in a boarding-school.She was very much absorbed in her own little boy and girl, and wasrather glad to hand the child over to the woman Mr. Archibald Cravensent to meet her, in London. The woman was his housekeeper atMisselthwaite Manor, and her name was Mrs. Medlock. She was a stoutwoman, with very red cheeks and sharp black eyes. She wore a very purpledress, a black silk mantle with jet fringe on it and a black bonnet withpurple velvet flowers which stuck up and trembled when she moved herhead. Mary did not like her at all, but as she very seldom liked peoplethere was nothing remarkable in that; besides which it was very evidentMrs. Medlock did not think much of her.""My word! she's a plain little piece of goods!"" she said. ""And we'dheard that her mother was a beauty. She hasn't handed much of it down,has she, ma'am?""""Perhaps she will improve as she grows older,"" the officer's wife saidgood-naturedly. ""If she were not so sallow and had a nicer expression,her features are rather good. Children alter so much.""""She'll have to alter a good deal,"" answered Mrs. Medlock. ""And there'snothing likely to improve children at Misselthwaite—if you ask me!""They thought Mary was not listening because she was standing a littleapart from them at the window of the private hotel they had gone to. Shewas watching the passing buses and cabs, and people, but she heard quitewell and was made very curious about her uncle and the place he livedin. What sort of a place was it, and what would he be like? What was ahunchback? She had never seen one. Perhaps there were none in India.Since she had been living in other people's houses and had had no Ayah,she had begun to feel lonely and to think queer thoughts which were newto her. She had begun to wonder why she had never seemed to belong toany one even when her father and mother had been alive. Other childrenseemed to belong to their fathers and mothers, but she had never seemedto really be any one's little girl. She had had servants, and food andclothes, but no one had taken any notice of her. She did not know thatthis was because she was a disagreeable child; but then, of course, shedid not know she was disagreeable. She often thought that other peoplewere, but she did not know that she was so herself.She thought Mrs. Medlock the most disagreeable person she had ever seen,with her common, highly colored face and her common fine bonnet. Whenthe next day they set out on their journey to Yorkshire, she walkedthrough the station to the railway carriage with her head up and tryingto keep as far away from her as she could, because she did not want toseem to belong to her. It would have made her very angry to think peopleimagined she was her little girl.But Mrs. Medlock was not in the least disturbed by her and her thoughts.She was the kind of woman who would ""stand no nonsense from young ones.""At least, that is what she would have said if she had been asked. Shehad not wanted to go to London just when her sister Maria's daughter wasgoing to be married, but she had a comfortable, well paid place ashousekeeper at Misselthwaite Manor and the only way in which she couldkeep it was to do at once what Mr. Archibald Craven told her to do. Shenever dared even to ask a question.""Captain Lennox and his wife died of the cholera,"" Mr. Craven had saidin his short, cold way. ""Captain Lennox was my wife's brother and I amtheir daughter's guardian. The child is to be brought here. You must goto London and bring her yourself.""So she packed her small trunk and made the journey.Mary sat in her corner of the railway carriage and looked plain andfretful. She had nothing to read or to look at, and she had folded herthin little black-gloved hands in her lap. Her black dress made her lookyellower than ever, and her limp light hair straggled from under herblack crêpe hat.""A more marred-looking young one I never saw in my life,"" Mrs. Medlockthought. (Marred is a Yorkshire word and means spoiled and pettish.) Shehad never seen a child who sat so still without doing anything; and atlast she got tired of watching her and began to talk in a brisk, hardvoice.""I suppose I may as well tell you something about where you are goingto,"" she said. ""Do you know anything about your uncle?""""No,"" said Mary.""Never heard your father and mother talk about him?""""No,"" said Mary frowning. She frowned because she remembered that herfather and mother had never talked to her about anything in particular.Certainly they had never told her things.""Humph,"" muttered Mrs. Medlock, staring at her queer, unresponsivelittle face. She did not say any more for a few moments and then shebegan again.""I suppose you might as well be told something—to prepare you. You aregoing to a queer place.""Mary said nothing at all, and Mrs. Medlock looked rather discomfited byher apparent indifference, but, after taking a breath, she went on.""Not but that it's a grand big place in a gloomy way, and Mr. Craven'sproud of it in his way—and that's gloomy enough, too. The house is sixhundred years old and it's on the edge of the moor, and there's near ahundred rooms in it, though most of them's shut up and locked. Andthere's pictures and fine old furniture and things that's been there forages, and there's a big park round it and gardens and trees withbranches trailing to the ground—some of them."" She paused and tookanother breath. ""But there's nothing else,"" she ended suddenly.Mary had begun to listen in spite of herself. It all sounded so unlikeIndia, and anything new rather attracted her. But she did not intend tolook as if she were interested. That was one of her unhappy,disagreeable ways. So she sat still.""Well,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""What do you think of it?""""Nothing,"" she answered. ""I know nothing about such places.""That made Mrs. Medlock laugh a short sort of laugh.""Eh!"" she said, ""but you are like an old woman. Don't you care?""""It doesn't matter,"" said Mary, ""whether I care or not.""""You are right enough there,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""It doesn't. Whatyou're to be kept at Misselthwaite Manor for I don't know, unlessbecause it's the easiest way. He's not going to trouble himself aboutyou, that's sure and certain. He never troubles himself about no one.""She stopped herself as if she had just remembered something in time.""He's got a crooked back,"" she said. ""That set him wrong. He was a souryoung man and got no good of all his money and big place till he wasmarried.""Mary's eyes turned toward her in spite of her intention not to seem tocare. She had never thought of the hunchback's being married and she wasa trifle surprised. Mrs. Medlock saw this, and as she was a talkativewoman she continued with more interest. This was one way of passing someof the time, at any rate.""She was a sweet, pretty thing and he'd have walked the world over toget her a blade o' grass she wanted. Nobody thought she'd marry him, butshe did, and people said she married him for his money. But shedidn't—she didn't,"" positively. ""When she died—""Mary gave a little involuntary jump.""Oh! did she die!"" she exclaimed, quite without meaning to. She had justremembered a French fairy story she had once read called ""Riquet à laHouppe."" It had been about a poor hunchback and a beautiful princess andit had made her suddenly sorry for Mr. Archibald Craven.""Yes, she died,"" Mrs. Medlock answered. ""And it made him queerer thanever. He cares about nobody. He won't see people. Most of the time hegoes away, and when he is at Misselthwaite he shuts himself up in theWest Wing and won't let any one but Pitcher see him. Pitcher's an oldfellow, but he took care of him when he was a child and he knows hisways.""It sounded like something in a book and it did not make Mary feelcheerful. A house with a hundred rooms, nearly all shut up and withtheir doors locked—a house on the edge of a moor—whatsoever a moorwas—sounded dreary. A man with a crooked back who shut himself up also!She stared out of the window with her lips pinched together, and itseemed quite natural that the rain should have begun to pour down ingray slanting lines and splash and stream down the window-panes. If thepretty wife had been alive she might have made things cheerful by beingsomething like her own mother and by running in and out and going toparties as she had done in frocks ""full of lace."" But she was not thereany more.""You needn't expect to see him, because ten to one you won't,"" said Mrs.Medlock. ""And you mustn't expect that there will be people to talk toyou. You'll have to play about and look after yourself. You'll be toldwhat rooms you can go into and what rooms you're to keep out of. There'sgardens enough. But when you're in the house don't go wandering andpoking about. Mr. Craven won't have it.""""I shall not want to go poking about,"" said sour little Mary; and justas suddenly as she had begun to be rather sorry for Mr. Archibald Cravenshe began to cease to be sorry and to think he was unpleasant enough todeserve all that had happened to him.And she turned her face toward the streaming panes of the window of therailway carriage and gazed out at the gray rain-storm which looked as ifit would go on forever and ever. She watched it so long and steadilythat the grayness grew heavier and heavier before her eyes and she fellasleep."

The rain seemed to bestreaming down more heavily than ever and everybody in the station worewet and glistening waterproofs. The guard lighted the lamps in thecarriage, and Mrs. Medlock cheered up very much over her tea and chickenand beef. She ate a great deal and afterward fell asleep herself, andMary sat and stared at her and watched her fine bonnet slip on one sideuntil she herself fell asleep once more in the corner of the carriage,lulled by the splashing of the rain against the windows. It was quitedark when she awakened again. The train had stopped at a station andMrs. Medlock was shaking her.""You have had a sleep!"" she said. ""It's time to open your eyes! We're atThwaite Station and we've got a long drive before us.""Mary stood up and tried to keep her eyes open while Mrs. Medlockcollected her parcels. The little girl did not offer to help her,because in India native servants always picked up or carried things andit seemed quite proper that other people should wait on one.The station was a small one and nobody but themselves seemed to begetting out of the train. The station-master spoke to Mrs. Medlock in arough, good-natured way, pronouncing his words in a queer broad fashionwhich Mary found out afterward was Yorkshire.""I see tha's got back,"" he said. ""An' tha's browt th' young 'un withthee.""""Aye, that's her,"" answered Mrs. Medlock, speaking with a Yorkshireaccent herself and jerking her head over her shoulder toward Mary.""How's thy Missus?""""Well enow. Th' carriage is waitin' outside for thee.""A brougham stood on the road before the little outside platform. Marysaw that it was a smart carriage and that it was a smart footman whohelped her in. His long waterproof coat and the waterproof covering ofhis hat were shining and dripping with rain as everything was, the burlystation-master included.When he shut the door, mounted the box with the coachman, and they droveoff, the little girl found herself seated in a comfortably cushionedcorner, but she was not inclined to go to sleep again. She sat andlooked out of the window, curious to see something of the road overwhich she was being driven to the queer place Mrs. Medlock had spokenof. She was not at all a timid child and she was not exactly frightened,but she felt that there was no knowing what might happen in a house witha hundred rooms nearly all shut up—a house standing on the edge of amoor.""What is a moor?"" she said suddenly to Mrs. Medlock.""Look out of the window in about ten minutes and you'll see,"" the womananswered. ""We've got to drive five miles across Missel Moor before weget to the Manor. You won't see much because it's a dark night, but youcan see something.""Mary asked no more questions but waited in the darkness of her corner,keeping her eyes on the window. The carriage lamps cast rays of light alittle distance ahead of them and she caught glimpses of the things theypassed. After they had left the station they had driven through a tinyvillage and she had seen whitewashed cottages and the lights of a publichouse. Then they had passed a church and a vicarage and a littleshop-window or so in a cottage with toys and sweets and odd things setout for sale. Then they were on the highroad and she saw hedges andtrees. After that there seemed nothing different for a long time—or atleast it seemed a long time to her.At last the horses began to go more slowly, as if they were climbingup-hill, and presently there seemed to be no more hedges and no moretrees. She could see nothing, in fact, but a dense darkness on eitherside. She leaned forward and pressed her face against the window just asthe carriage gave a big jolt.""Eh! We're on the moor now sure enough,"" said Mrs. Medlock.The carriage lamps shed a yellow light on a rough-looking road whichseemed to be cut through bushes and low growing things which ended inthe great expanse of dark apparently spread out before and around them.A wind was rising and making a singular, wild, low, rushing sound.""It's—it's not the sea, is it?"" said Mary, looking round at hercompanion.""No, not it,"" answered Mrs. Medlock. ""Nor it isn't fields nor mountains,it's just miles and miles and miles of wild land that nothing grows onbut heather and gorse and broom, and nothing lives on but wild poniesand sheep.""""I feel as if it might be the sea, if there were water on it,"" saidMary. ""It sounds like the sea just now.""""That's the wind blowing through the bushes,"" Mrs. Medlock said. ""It's awild, dreary enough place to my mind, though there's plenty that likesit—particularly when the heather's in bloom.""On and on they drove through the darkness, and though the rain stopped,the wind rushed by and whistled and made strange sounds. The road wentup and down, and several times the carriage passed over a little bridgebeneath which water rushed very fast with a great deal of noise. Maryfelt as if the drive would never come to an end and that the wide, bleakmoor was a wide expanse of black ocean through which she was passing ona strip of dry land.""I don't like it,"" she said to herself. ""I don't like it,"" and shepinched her thin lips more tightly together.The horses were climbing up a hilly piece of road when she first caughtsight of a light. Mrs. Medlock saw it as soon as she did and drew a longsigh of relief.""Eh, I am glad to see that bit o' light twinkling,"" she exclaimed. ""It'sthe light in the lodge window. We shall get a good cup of tea after abit, at all events.""It was ""after a bit,"" as she said, for when the carriage passed throughthe park gates there was still two miles of avenue to drive through andthe trees (which nearly met overhead) made it seem as if they weredriving through a long dark vault.They drove out of the vault into a clear space and stopped before animmensely long but low-built house which seemed to ramble round a stonecourt. At first Mary thought that there were no lights at all in thewindows, but as she got out of the carriage she saw that one room in acorner up-stairs showed a dull glow.The entrance door was a huge one made of massive, curiously shapedpanels of oak studded with big iron nails and bound with great ironbars. It opened into an enormous hall, which was so dimly lighted thatthe faces in the portraits on the walls and the figures in the suits ofarmor made Mary feel that she did not want to look at them. As she stoodon the stone floor she looked a very small, odd little black figure, andshe felt as small and lost and odd as she looked.A neat, thin old man stood near the manservant who opened the door forthem.""You are to take her to her room,"" he said in a husky voice. ""He doesn'twant to see her. He's going to London in the morning.""""Very well, Mr. Pitcher,"" Mrs. Medlock answered. ""So long as I knowwhat's expected of me, I can manage.""""What's expected of you, Mrs. Medlock,"" Mr. Pitcher said, ""is that youmake sure that he's not disturbed and that he doesn't see what hedoesn't want to see.""And then Mary Lennox was led up a broad staircase and down a longcorridor and up a short flight of steps and through another corridor andanother, until a door opened in a wall and she found herself in a roomwith a fire in it and a supper on a table.Mrs. Medlock said unceremoniously:""Well, here you are! This room and the next are where you'll live—andyou must keep to them. Don't you forget that!""It was in this way Mistress Mary arrived at Misselthwaite Manor and shehad perhaps never felt quite so contrary in all her life."

",物語は、孤児となり、謎めいたミッセルスウェイト荘で隠遁生活を送る叔父のもとで暮らすことになった、不機嫌で甘やかされた子供メアリー・レノックスを中心に展開する,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/17396/images/cover-tb.jpg,MARTHA,"When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaidhad come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on thehearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her fora few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seena room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls werecovered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There werefantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance therewas a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and horsesand dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them.Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of landwhich seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless,dull, purplish sea.""What is that?"" she said, pointing out of the window.Martha, the young housemaid, who had just risen to her feet, looked andpointed also.""That there?"" she said.""Yes.""""That's th' moor,"" with a good-natured grin. ""Does tha' like it?""""No,"" answered Mary. ""I hate it.""""That's because tha'rt not used to it,"" Martha said, going back to herhearth. ""Tha' thinks it's too big an' bare now. But tha' will like it.""""Do you?"" inquired Mary.""Aye, that I do,"" answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at thegrate. ""I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' thingsas smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorsean' broom an' heather's in flower. It smells o' honey an' there's such alot o' fresh air—an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarksmakes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'. Eh! I wouldn't live awayfrom th' moor for anythin'.""Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The nativeservants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this.They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to theirmasters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them""protector of the poor"" and names of that sort. Indian servants werecommanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say""please"" and ""thank you"" and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in theface when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would doif one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-naturedlooking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Marywonder if she might not even slap back—if the person who slapped herwas only a little girl.""You are a strange servant,"" she said from her pillows, ratherhaughtily.Martha sat up on her heels, with her blacking-brush in her hand, andlaughed, without seeming the least out of temper.""Eh! I know that,"" she said. ""If there was a grand Missus atMisselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under housemaids.I might have been let to be scullery-maid but I'd never have been letup-stairs. I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is afunny house for all it's so grand. Seems like there's neither Master norMistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he won't betroubled about anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away.Mrs. Medlock gave me th' place out o' kindness. She told me she couldnever have done it if Misselthwaite had been like other big houses.""""Are you going to be my servant?"" Mary asked, still in her imperiouslittle Indian way.Martha began to rub her grate again.""I'm Mrs. Medlock's servant,"" she said stoutly. ""An' she's Mr.Craven's—but I'm to do the housemaid's work up here an' wait on you abit. But you won't need much waitin' on.""""Who is going to dress me?"" demanded Mary.Martha sat up on her heels again and stared. She spoke in broadYorkshire in her amazement.""Canna' tha' dress thysen!"" she said.""What do you mean? I don't understand your language,"" said Mary.""Eh! I forgot,"" Martha said. ""Mrs. Medlock told me I'd have to becareful or you wouldn't know what I was sayin'. I mean can't you put onyour own clothes?""""No,"" answered Mary, quite indignantly. ""I never did in my life. My Ayahdressed me, of course.""""Well,"" said Martha, evidently not in the least aware that she wasimpudent, ""it's time tha' should learn. Tha' cannot begin younger. It'lldo thee good to wait on thysen a bit. My mother always said she couldn'tsee why grand people's children didn't turn out fair fools—what withnurses an' bein' washed an' dressed an' took out to walk as if they waspuppies!""""It is different in India,"" said Mistress Mary disdainfully. She couldscarcely stand this.But Martha was not at all crushed.""Eh! I can see it's different,"" she answered almost sympathetically. ""Idare say it's because there's such a lot o' blacks there instead o'respectable white people. When I heard you was comin' from India Ithought you was a black too.""Mary sat up in bed furious.""What!"" she said. ""What! You thought I was a native. You—you daughterof a pig!""Martha stared and looked hot.""Who are you callin' names?"" she said. ""You needn't be so vexed. That'snot th' way for a young lady to talk. I've nothin' against th' blacks.When you read about 'em in tracts they're always very religious. Youalways read as a black's a man an' a brother. I've never seen a blackan' I was fair pleased to think I was goin' to see one close. When Icome in to light your fire this mornin' I crep' up to your bed an'pulled th' cover back careful to look at you. An' there you was,""disappointedly, ""no more black than me—for all you're so yeller.""Mary did not even try to control her rage and humiliation.""You thought I was a native! You dared! You don't know anything aboutnatives! They are not people—they're servants who must salaam to you.You know nothing about India. You know nothing about anything!""She was in such a rage and felt so helpless before the girl's simplestare, and somehow she suddenly felt so horribly lonely and far awayfrom everything she understood and which understood her, that she threwherself face downward on the pillows and burst into passionate sobbing.She sobbed so unrestrainedly that good-natured Yorkshire Martha was alittle frightened and quite sorry for her. She went to the bed and bentover her.""Eh! you mustn't cry like that there!"" she begged. ""You mustn't forsure. I didn't know you'd be vexed. I don't know anythin' aboutanythin'—just like you said. I beg your pardon, Miss. Do stop cryin'.""There was something comforting and really friendly in her queerYorkshire speech and sturdy way which had a good effect on Mary. Shegradually ceased crying and became quiet. Martha looked relieved.""It's time for thee to get up now,"" she said. ""Mrs. Medlock said I wasto carry tha' breakfast an' tea an' dinner into th' room next to this.It's been made into a nursery for thee. I'll help thee on with thyclothes if tha'll get out o' bed. If th' buttons are at th' back tha'cannot button them up tha'self.""When Mary at last decided to get up, the clothes Martha took from thewardrobe were not the ones she had worn when she arrived the nightbefore with Mrs. Medlock.""Those are not mine,"" she said. ""Mine are black.""She looked the thick white wool coat and dress over, and added with coolapproval:""Those are nicer than mine.""""These are th' ones tha' must put on,"" Martha answered. ""Mr. Cravenordered Mrs. Medlock to get 'em in London. He said 'I won't have a childdressed in black wanderin' about like a lost soul,' he said. 'It'd makethe place sadder than it is. Put color on her.' Mother she said she knewwhat he meant. Mother always knows what a body means. She doesn't holdwith black hersel'.""""I hate black things,"" said Mary.The dressing process was one which taught them both something. Marthahad ""buttoned up"" her little sisters and brothers but she had never seena child who stood still and waited for another person to do things forher as if she had neither hands nor feet of her own.""Why doesn't tha' put on tha' own shoes?"" she said when Mary quietlyheld out her foot.""My Ayah did it,"" answered Mary, staring. ""It was the custom.""She said that very often—""It was the custom."" The native servants werealways saying it. If one told them to do a thing their ancestors had notdone for a thousand years they gazed at one mildly and said, ""It is notthe custom"" and one knew that was the end of the matter.It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything butstand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she wasready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at MisselthwaiteManor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new toher—things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and pickingup things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine younglady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful andwould have known that it was her business to brush hair, and buttonboots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only anuntrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottagewith a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed ofdoing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones whowere either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumbleover things.If Mary Lennox had been a child who was ready to be amused she wouldperhaps have laughed at Martha's readiness to talk, but Mary onlylistened to her coldly and wondered at her freedom of manner. At firstshe was not at all interested, but gradually, as the girl rattled on inher good-tempered, homely way, Mary began to notice what she was saying.""Eh! you should see 'em all,"" she said. ""There's twelve of us an' myfather only gets sixteen shilling a week. I can tell you my mother's putto it to get porridge for 'em all. They tumble about on th' moor an'play there all day an' mother says th' air of th' moor fattens 'em. Shesays she believes they eat th' grass same as th' wild ponies do. OurDickon, he's twelve years old and he's got a young pony he calls hisown.""""Where did he get it?"" asked Mary.""He found it on th' moor with its mother when it was a little one an' hebegan to make friends with it an' give it bits o' bread an' pluck younggrass for it. And it got to like him so it follows him about an' itlets him get on its back. Dickon's a kind lad an' animals likes him.""Mary had never possessed an animal pet of her own and had always thoughtshe should like one. So she began to feel a slight interest in Dickon,and as she had never before been interested in any one but herself, itwas the dawning of a healthy sentiment. When she went into the roomwhich had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was ratherlike the one she had slept in. It was not a child's room, but a grown-upperson's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oakchairs. A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast.But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked withsomething more than indifference at the first plate Martha set beforeher.""I don't want it,"" she said.""Tha' doesn't want thy porridge!"" Martha exclaimed incredulously.""No.""""Tha' doesn't know how good it is. Put a bit o' treacle on it or a bito' sugar.""""I don't want it,"" repeated Mary.""Eh!"" said Martha. ""I can't abide to see good victuals go to waste. Ifour children was at this table they'd clean it bare in five minutes.""""Why?"" said Mary coldly.""Why!"" echoed Martha. ""Because they scarce ever had their stomachs fullin their lives. They're as hungry as young hawks an' foxes.""""I don't know what it is to be hungry,"" said Mary, with the indifferenceof ignorance.Martha looked indignant.""Well, it would do thee good to try it. I can see that plain enough,""she said outspokenly. ""I've no patience with folk as sits an' juststares at good bread an' meat. My word! don't I wish Dickon and Phil an'Jane an' th' rest of 'em had what's here under their pinafores.""""Why don't you take it to them?"" suggested Mary.""It's not mine,"" answered Martha stoutly. ""An' this isn't my day out. Iget my day out once a month same as th' rest. Then I go home an' cleanup for mother an' give her a day's rest.""Mary drank some tea and ate a little toast and some marmalade.""You wrap up warm an' run out an' play you,"" said Martha. ""It'll do yougood and give you some stomach for your meat.""Mary went to the window. There were gardens and paths and big trees, buteverything looked dull and wintry.""Out? Why should I go out on a day like this?""""Well, if tha' doesn't go out tha'lt have to stay in, an' what has tha'got to do?""Mary glanced about her. There was nothing to do. When Mrs. Medlock hadprepared the nursery she had not thought of amusement. Perhaps it wouldbe better to go and see what the gardens were like.""Who will go with me?"" she inquired.Martha stared.""You'll go by yourself,"" she answered. ""You'll have to learn to playlike other children does when they haven't got sisters and brothers. OurDickon goes off on th' moor by himself an' plays for hours. That's howhe made friends with th' pony. He's got sheep on th' moor that knowshim, an' birds as comes an' eats out of his hand. However little thereis to eat, he always saves a bit o' his bread to coax his pets.""It was really this mention of Dickon which made Mary decide to go out,though she was not aware of it. There would be birds outside thoughthere would not be ponies or sheep. They would be different from thebirds in India and it might amuse her to look at them.Martha found her coat and hat for her and a pair of stout little bootsand she showed her her way down-stairs.""If tha' goes round that way tha'll come to th' gardens,"" she said,pointing to a gate in a wall of shrubbery. ""There's lots o' flowers insummer-time, but there's nothin' bloomin' now."" She seemed to hesitate asecond before she added, ""One of th' gardens is locked up. No one hasbeen in it for ten years.""""Why?"" asked Mary in spite of herself. Here was another locked dooradded to the hundred in the strange house.""Mr. Craven had it shut when his wife died so sudden. He won't let noone go inside. It was her garden. He locked th' door an' dug a hole andburied th' key. There's Mrs. Medlock's bell ringing—I must run.""After she was gone Mary turned down the walk which led to the door inthe shrubbery. She could not help thinking about the garden which no onehad been into for ten years. She wondered what it would look like andwhether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had passedthrough the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with widelawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were trees, andflower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a largepool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds werebare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not thegarden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up? You couldalways walk into a garden.She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path shewas following, there seemed to be a long wall, with ivy growing over it.She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was comingupon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing.She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in theivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden, evidently,and she could go into it.She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls allround it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemedto open into one another. She saw another open green door, revealingbushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables.Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of thebeds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly enough, Marythought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be nicer in summerwhen things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.Presently an old man with a spade over his shoulder walked through thedoor leading from the second garden. He looked startled when he sawMary, and then touched his cap. He had a surly old face, and did notseem at all pleased to see her—but then she was displeased with hisgarden and wore her ""quite contrary"" expression, and certainly did notseem at all pleased to see him.""What is this place?"" she asked.""One o' th' kitchen-gardens,"" he answered.""What is that?"" said Mary, pointing through the other green door.""Another of 'em,"" shortly. ""There's another on t'other side o' th' wallan' there's th' orchard t'other side o' that.""""Can I go in them?"" asked Mary.""If tha' likes. But there's nowt to see.""Mary made no response. She went down the path and through the secondgreen door. There she found more walls and winter vegetables and glassframes, but in the second wall there was another green door and it wasnot open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for tenyears. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what shewanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. Shehoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she hadfound the mysterious garden—but it did open quite easily and she walkedthrough it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all roundit also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-treesgrowing in the winter-browned grass—but there was no green door to beseen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered theupper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem toend with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a placeat the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, andwhen she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting onthe topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his wintersong—almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.She stopped and listened to him and somehow his cheerful, friendlylittle whistle gave her a pleased feeling—even a disagreeable littlegirl may be lonely, and the big closed house and big bare moor and bigbare gardens had made this one feel as if there was no one left in theworld but herself. If she had been an affectionate child, who had beenused to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even thoughshe was ""Mistress Mary Quite Contrary"" she was desolate, and thebright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little facewhich was almost a smile. She listened to him until he flew away. He wasnot like an Indian bird and she liked him and wondered if she shouldever see him again. Perhaps he lived in the mysterious garden and knewall about it.Perhaps it was because she had nothing whatever to do that she thoughtso much of the deserted garden. She was curious about it and wanted tosee what it was like. Why had Mr. Archibald Craven buried the key? If hehad liked his wife so much why did he hate her garden? She wondered ifshe should ever see him, but she knew that if she did she should notlike him, and he would not like her, and that she should only stand andstare at him and say nothing, though she should be wanting dreadfully toask him why he had done such a queer thing.""People never like me and I never like people,"" she thought. ""And Inever can talk as the Crawford children could. They were always talkingand laughing and making noises.""She thought of the robin and of the way he seemed to sing his song ather, and as she remembered the tree-top he perched on she stopped rathersuddenly on the path.""I believe that tree was in the secret garden—I feel sure it was,"" shesaid. ""There was a wall round the place and there was no door.""She walked back into the first kitchen-garden she had entered and foundthe old man digging there. She went and stood beside him and watchedhim a few moments in her cold little way. He took no notice of her andso at last she spoke to him.""I have been into the other gardens,"" she said.""There was nothin' to prevent thee,"" he answered crustily.""I went into the orchard.""""There was no dog at th' door to bite thee,"" he answered.""There was no door there into the other garden,"" said Mary.""What garden?"" he said in a rough voice, stopping his digging for amoment.""The one on the other side of the wall,"" answered Mistress Mary. ""Thereare trees there—I saw the tops of them. A bird with a red breast wassitting on one of them and he sang.""To her surprise the surly old weather-beaten face actually changed itsexpression. A slow smile spread over it and the gardener looked quitedifferent. It made her think that it was curious how much nicer a personlooked when he smiled. She had not thought of it before.He turned about to the orchard side of his garden and began towhistle—a low soft whistle. She could not understand how such a surlyman could make such a coaxing sound.Almost the next moment a wonderful thing happened. She heard a softlittle rushing flight through the air—and it was the bird with the redbreast flying to them, and he actually alighted on the big clod of earthquite near to the gardener's foot.""Here he is,"" chuckled the old man, and then he spoke to the bird as ifhe were speaking to a child.""Where has tha' been, tha' cheeky little beggar?"" he said. ""I've notseen thee before to-day. Has tha' begun tha' courtin' this early in th'season? Tha'rt too forrad.""The bird put his tiny head on one side and looked up at him with hissoft bright eye which was like a black dewdrop. He seemed quite familiarand not the least afraid. He hopped about and pecked the earth briskly,looking for seeds and insects. It actually gave Mary a queer feeling inher heart, because he was so pretty and cheerful and seemed so like aperson. He had a tiny plump body and a delicate beak, and slenderdelicate legs.""Will he always come when you call him?"" she asked almost in a whisper.""Aye, that he will. I've knowed him ever since he was a fledgling. Hecome out of th' nest in th' other garden an' when first he flew overth' wall he was too weak to fly back for a few days an' we gotfriendly. When he went over th' wall again th' rest of th' brood wasgone an' he was lonely an' he come back to me.""""What kind of a bird is he?"" Mary asked.""Doesn't tha' know? He's a robin redbreast an' they're th' friendliest,curiousest birds alive. They're almost as friendly as dogs—if you knowhow to get on with 'em. Watch him peckin' about there an' lookin' roundat us now an' again. He knows we're talkin' about him.""It was the queerest thing in the world to see the old fellow. He lookedat the plump little scarlet-waistcoated bird as if he were both proudand fond of him.""He's a conceited one,"" he chuckled. ""He likes to hear folk talk abouthim. An' curious—bless me, there never was his like for curiosity an'meddlin'. He's always comin' to see what I'm plantin'. He knows all th'things Mester Craven never troubles hissel' to find out. He's th' headgardener, he is.""The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stoppedand looked at them a little. Mary thought his black dewdrop eyes gazedat her with great curiosity. It really seemed as if he were finding outall about her. The queer feeling in her heart increased.""Where did the rest of the brood fly to?"" she asked.""There's no knowin'. The old ones turn 'em out o' their nest an' make'em fly an' they're scattered before you know it. This one was a knowin'one an' he knew he was lonely.""Mistress Mary went a step nearer to the robin and looked at him veryhard.""I'm lonely,"" she said.She had not known before that this was one of the things which made herfeel sour and cross. She seemed to find it out when the robin looked ather and she looked at the robin.The old gardener pushed his cap back on his bald head and stared at hera minute.""Art tha' th' little wench from India?"" he asked.Mary nodded.""Then no wonder tha'rt lonely. Tha'lt be lonelier before tha's done,"" hesaid.He began to dig again, driving his spade deep into the rich black gardensoil while the robin hopped about very busily employed.""What is your name?"" Mary inquired.He stood up to answer her.""Ben Weatherstaff,"" he answered, and then he added with a surly chuckle,""I'm lonely mysel' except when he's with me,"" and he jerked his thumbtoward the robin. ""He's th' only friend I've got.""""I have no friends at all,"" said Mary. ""I never had. My Ayah didn't likeme and I never played with any one.""It is a Yorkshire habit to say what you think with blunt frankness, andold Ben Weatherstaff was a Yorkshire moor man.""Tha' an' me are a good bit alike,"" he said. ""We was wove out of th'same cloth. We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us assour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'llwarrant.""This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth aboutherself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted toyou, whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, butshe wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she alsowondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came.She actually began to wonder also if she was ""nasty tempered."" She feltuncomfortable.Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turnedround. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robinhad flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of asong. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.""What did he do that for?"" asked Mary.""He's made up his mind to make friends with thee,"" replied Ben. ""Dang meif he hasn't took a fancy to thee.""""To me?"" said Mary, and she moved toward the little tree softly andlooked up.""Would you make friends with me?"" she said to the robin just as if shewas speaking to a person. ""Would you?"" And she did not say it either inher hard little voice or in her imperious Indian voice, but in a tone sosoft and eager and coaxing that Ben Weatherstaff was as surprised as shehad been when she heard him whistle.""Why,"" he cried out, ""tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was areal child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha' said it almost like Dickontalks to his wild things on th' moor.""""Do you know Dickon?"" Mary asked, turning round rather in a hurry.""Everybody knows him. Dickon's wanderin' about everywhere. Th' veryblackberries an' heather-bells knows him. I warrant th' foxes shows himwhere their cubs lies an' th' skylarks doesn't hide their nests fromhim.""Mary would have liked to ask some more questions. She was almost ascurious about Dickon as she was about the deserted garden. But just thatmoment the robin, who had ended his song, gave a little shake of hiswings, spread them and flew away. He had made his visit and had otherthings to do.""He has flown over the wall!"" Mary cried out, watching him. ""He hasflown into the orchard—he has flown across the other wall—into thegarden where there is no door!""""He lives there,"" said old Ben. ""He came out o' th' egg there. If he'scourtin', he's makin' up to some young madam of a robin that lives amongth' old rose-trees there.""""Rose-trees,"" said Mary. ""Are there rose-trees?""Ben Weatherstaff took up his spade again and began to dig.""There was ten year' ago,"" he mumbled.""I should like to see them,"" said Mary. ""Where is the green door?

Every morning she awoke in her tapestried room and found Marthakneeling upon the hearth building her fire; every morning she ate herbreakfast in the nursery which had nothing amusing in it; and after eachbreakfast she gazed out of the window across to the huge moor whichseemed to spread out on all sides and climb up to the sky, and after shehad stared for a while she realized that if she did not go out she wouldhave to stay in and do nothing—and so she went out. She did not knowthat this was the best thing she could have done, and she did not knowthat, when she began to walk quickly or even run along the paths anddown the avenue, she was stirring her slow blood and making herselfstronger by fighting with the wind which swept down from the moor. Sheran only to make herself warm, and she hated the wind which rushed ather face and roared and held her back as if it were some giant she couldnot see. But the big breaths of rough fresh air blown over the heatherfilled her lungs with something which was good for her whole thin bodyand whipped some red color into her cheeks and brightened her dull eyeswhen she did not know anything about it.But after a few days spent almost entirely out of doors she wakened onemorning knowing what it was to be hungry, and when she sat down to herbreakfast she did not glance disdainfully at her porridge and push itaway, but took up her spoon and began to eat it and went on eating ituntil her bowl was empty.""Tha' got on well enough with that this mornin', didn't tha'?"" saidMartha.""It tastes nice to-day,"" said Mary, feeling a little surprised herself.""It's th' air of th' moor that's givin' thee stomach for tha' victuals,""answered Martha. ""It's lucky for thee that tha's got victuals as well asappetite. There's been twelve in our cottage as had th' stomach an'nothin' to put in it. You go on playin' you out o' doors every day an'you'll get some flesh on your bones an' you won't be so yeller.""""I don't play,"" said Mary. ""I have nothing to play with.""""Nothin' to play with!"" exclaimed Martha. ""Our children plays withsticks and stones. They just runs about an' shouts an' looks at things.""Mary did not shout, but she looked at things. There was nothing else todo. She walked round and round the gardens and wandered about the pathsin the park. Sometimes she looked for Ben Weatherstaff, but thoughseveral times she saw him at work he was too busy to look at her or wastoo surly. Once when she was walking toward him he picked up his spadeand turned away as if he did it on purpose.One place she went to oftener than to any other. It was the long walkoutside the gardens with the walls round them. There were bareflower-beds on either side of it and against the walls ivy grew thickly.There was one part of the wall where the creeping dark green leaves weremore bushy than elsewhere. It seemed as if for a long time that part hadbeen neglected. The rest of it had been clipped and made to look neat,but at this lower end of the walk it had not been trimmed at all.A few days after she had talked to Ben Weatherstaff Mary stopped tonotice this and wondered why it was so. She had just paused and waslooking up at a long spray of ivy swinging in the wind when she saw agleam of scarlet and heard a brilliant chirp, and there, on the top ofthe wall, perched Ben Weatherstaff's robin redbreast, tilting forwardto look at her with his small head on one side.""Oh!"" she cried out, ""is it you—is it you?"" And it did not seem at allqueer to her that she spoke to him as if she was sure that he wouldunderstand and answer her.He did answer. He twittered and chirped and hopped along the wall as ifhe were telling her all sorts of things. It seemed to Mistress Mary asif she understood him, too, though he was not speaking in words. It wasas if he said:""Good morning! Isn't the wind nice? Isn't the sun nice? Isn't everythingnice? Let us both chirp and hop and twitter. Come on! Come on!""Mary began to laugh, and as he hopped and took little flights along thewall she ran after him. Poor little thin, sallow, ugly Mary—sheactually looked almost pretty for a moment.""I like you! I like you!"" she cried out, pattering down the walk; andshe chirped and tried to whistle, which last she did not know how to doin the least. But the robin seemed to be quite satisfied and chirped andwhistled back at her. At last he spread his wings and made a dartingflight to the top of a tree, where he perched and sang loudly.That reminded Mary of the first time she had seen him. He had beenswinging on a tree-top then and she had been standing in the orchard.Now she was on the other side of the orchard and standing in the pathoutside a wall—much lower down—and there was the same tree inside.""It's in the garden no one can go into,"" she said to herself. ""It's thegarden without a door. He lives in there. How I wish I could see what itis like!""She ran up the walk to the green door she had entered the first morning.Then she ran down the path through the other door and then into theorchard, and when she stood and looked up there was the tree on theother side of the wall, and there was the robin just finishing his songand beginning to preen his feathers with his beak.""It is the garden,"" she said. ""I am sure it is.""She walked round and looked closely at that side of the orchard wall,but she only found what she had found before—that there was no door init. Then she ran through the kitchen-gardens again and out into the walkoutside the long ivy-covered wall, and she walked to the end of it andlooked at it, but there was no door; and then she walked to the otherend, looking again, but there was no door.""It's very queer,"" she said. ""Ben Weatherstaff said there was no doorand there is no door. But there must have been one ten years ago,because Mr. Craven buried the key.""This gave her so much to think of that she began to be quite interestedand feel that she was not sorry that she had come to MisselthwaiteManor. In India she had always felt hot and too languid to care muchabout anything. The fact was that the fresh wind from the moor had begunto blow the cobwebs out of her young brain and to waken her up a little.She stayed out of doors nearly all day, and when she sat down to hersupper at night she felt hungry and drowsy and comfortable. She did notfeel cross when Martha chattered away. She felt as if she rather likedto hear her, and at last she thought she would ask her a question. Sheasked it after she had finished her supper and had sat down on thehearth-rug before the fire.""Why did Mr. Craven hate the garden?"" she said.She had made Martha stay with her and Martha had not objected at all.She was very young, and used to a crowded cottage full of brothers andsisters, and she found it dull in the great servants' hall down-stairswhere the footman and upper-housemaids made fun of her Yorkshire speechand looked upon her as a common little thing, and sat and whisperedamong themselves. Martha liked to talk, and the strange child who hadlived in India, and been waited upon by ""blacks,"" was novelty enough toattract her.She sat down on the hearth herself without waiting to be asked.""Art tha' thinkin' about that garden yet?"" she said. ""I knew tha' would.That was just the way with me when I first heard about it.""""Why did he hate it?"" Mary persisted.Martha tucked her feet under her and made herself quite comfortable.""Listen to th' wind wutherin' round the house,"" she said. ""You couldbare stand up on the moor if you was out on it to-night.""Mary did not know what ""wutherin'"" meant until she listened, and thenshe understood. It must mean that hollow shuddering sort of roar whichrushed round and round the house as if the giant no one could see werebuffeting it and beating at the walls and windows to try to break in.But one knew he could not get in, and somehow it made one feel very safeand warm inside a room with a red coal fire.""But why did he hate it so?"" she asked, after she had listened. Sheintended to know if Martha did.Then Martha gave up her store of knowledge.""Mind,"" she said, ""Mrs. Medlock said it's not to be talked about.There's lots o' things in this place that's not to be talked over.That's Mr. Craven's orders. His troubles are none servants' business, hesays. But for th' garden he wouldn't be like he is. It was Mrs. Craven'sgarden that she had made when first they were married an' she just lovedit, an' they used to 'tend the flowers themselves. An' none o' th'gardeners was ever let to go in. Him an' her used to go in an' shut th'door an' stay there hours an' hours, readin' an' talkin'. An' she wasjust a bit of a girl an' there was an old tree with a branch bent like aseat on it. An' she made roses grow over it an' she used to sit there.But one day when she was sittin' there th' branch broke an' she fell onth' ground an' was hurt so bad that next day she died. Th' doctorsthought he'd go out o' his mind an' die, too. That's why he hates it. Noone's never gone in since, an' he won't let any one talk about it.""Mary did not ask any more questions. She looked at the red fire andlistened to the wind ""wutherin'."" It seemed to be ""wutherin'"" louderthan ever.At that moment a very good thing was happening to her. Four good thingshad happened to her, in fact, since she came to Misselthwaite Manor. Shehad felt as if she had understood a robin and that he had understoodher; she had run in the wind until her blood had grown warm; she hadbeen healthily hungry for the first time in her life; and she had foundout what it was to be sorry for some one. She was getting on.But as she was listening to the wind she began to listen to somethingelse. She did not know what it was, because at first she could scarcelydistinguish it from the wind itself. It was a curious sound—it seemedalmost as if a child were crying somewhere. Sometimes the wind soundedrather like a child crying, but presently Mistress Mary felt quite surethat this sound was inside the house, not outside it. It was far away,but it was inside. She turned round and looked at Martha.""Do you hear any one crying?"" she said.Martha suddenly looked confused.""No,"" she answered. ""It's th' wind. Sometimes it sounds like as if someone was lost on th' moor an' wailin'. It's got all sorts o' sounds.""""But listen,"" said Mary. ""It's in the house—down one of those longcorridors.""And at that very moment a door must have been opened somewheredown-stairs; for a great rushing draft blew along the passage and thedoor of the room they sat in was blown open with a crash, and as theyboth jumped to their feet the light was blown out and the crying soundwas swept down the far corridor so that it was to be heard more plainlythan ever.""There!"" said Mary. ""I told you so! It is some one crying—and it isn't agrown-up person.""Martha ran and shut the door and turned the key, but before she did itthey both heard the sound of a door in some far passage shutting with abang, and then everything was quiet, for even the wind ceased""wutherin'"" for a few moments.""It was th' wind,"" said Martha stubbornly. ""An' if it wasn't, it waslittle Betty Butterworth, th' scullery-maid. She's had th' toothache allday.""But something troubled and awkward in her manner made Mistress Marystare very hard at her. She did not believe she was speaking the truth."

There could be no going out to-day.""What do you do in your cottage when it rains like this?"" she askedMartha.""Try to keep from under each other's feet mostly,"" Martha answered. ""Eh!there does seem a lot of us then. Mother's a good-tempered woman but shegets fair moithered. The biggest ones goes out in th' cow-shed and playsthere. Dickon he doesn't mind th' wet. He goes out just th' same as ifth' sun was shinin'. He says he sees things on rainy days as doesn'tshow when it's fair weather. He once found a little fox cub half drownedin its hole and he brought it home in th' bosom of his shirt to keep itwarm. Its mother had been killed nearby an' th' hole was swum out an'th' rest o' th' litter was dead. He's got it at home now. He found ahalf-drowned young crow another time an' he brought it home, too, an'tamed it. It's named Soot because it's so black, an' it hops an' fliesabout with him everywhere.""The time had come when Mary had forgotten to resent Martha's familiartalk. She had even begun to find it interesting and to be sorry when shestopped or went away. The stories she had been told by her Ayah when shelived in India had been quite unlike those Martha had to tell about themoorland cottage which held fourteen people who lived in four littlerooms and never had quite enough to eat. The children seemed to tumbleabout and amuse themselves like a litter of rough, good-natured colliepuppies. Mary was most attracted by the mother and Dickon. When Marthatold stories of what ""mother"" said or did they always soundedcomfortable.""If I had a raven or a fox cub I could play with it,"" said Mary. ""But Ihave nothing.""Martha looked perplexed.""Can tha' knit?"" she asked.""No,"" answered Mary.""Can tha' sew?""""No.""""Can tha' read?""""Yes.""""Then why doesn't tha' read somethin', or learn a bit o' spellin'?Tha'st old enough to be learnin' thy book a good bit now.""""I haven't any books,"" said Mary. ""Those I had were left in India.""""That's a pity,"" said Martha. ""If Mrs. Medlock'd let thee go into th'library, there's thousands o' books there.""Mary did not ask where the library was, because she was suddenlyinspired by a new idea. She made up her mind to go and find it herself.She was not troubled about Mrs. Medlock. Mrs. Medlock seemed always tobe in her comfortable housekeeper's sitting-room down-stairs. In thisqueer place one scarcely ever saw any one at all. In fact, there was noone to see but the servants, and when their master was away they lived aluxurious life below stairs, where there was a huge kitchen hung aboutwith shining brass and pewter, and a large servants' hall where therewere four or five abundant meals eaten every day, and where a great dealof lively romping went on when Mrs. Medlock was out of the way.Mary's meals were served regularly, and Martha waited on her, but no onetroubled themselves about her in the least. Mrs. Medlock came and lookedat her every day or two, but no one inquired what she did or told herwhat to do. She supposed that perhaps this was the English way oftreating children. In India she had always been attended by her Ayah,who had followed her about and waited on her, hand and foot. She hadoften been tired of her company. Now she was followed by nobody and waslearning to dress herself because Martha looked as though she thoughtshe was silly and stupid when she wanted to have things handed to herand put on.""Hasn't tha' got good sense?"" she said once, when Mary had stood waitingfor her to put on her gloves for her. ""Our Susan Ann is twice as sharpas thee an' she's only four year' old. Sometimes tha' looks fair soft inth' head.""Mary had worn her contrary scowl for an hour after that, but it made herthink several entirely new things.She stood at the window for about ten minutes this morning after Marthahad swept up the hearth for the last time and gone down-stairs. She wasthinking over the new idea which had come to her when she heard of thelibrary. She did not care very much about the library itself, becauseshe had read very few books; but to hear of it brought back to her mindthe hundred rooms with closed doors. She wondered if they were allreally locked and what she would find if she could get into any of them.Were there a hundred really? Why shouldn't she go and see how many doorsshe could count? It would be something to do on this morning when shecould not go out. She had never been taught to ask permission to dothings, and she knew nothing at all about authority, so she would nothave thought it necessary to ask Mrs. Medlock if she might walk aboutthe house, even if she had seen her.She opened the door of the room and went into the corridor, and then shebegan her wanderings. It was a long corridor and it branched into othercorridors and it led her up short flights of steps which mounted toothers again. There were doors and doors, and there were pictures on thewalls. Sometimes they were pictures of dark, curious landscapes, butoftenest they were portraits of men and women in queer, grand costumesmade of satin and velvet. She found herself in one long gallery whosewalls were covered with these portraits. She had never thought therecould be so many in any house. She walked slowly down this place andstared at the faces which also seemed to stare at her. She felt as ifthey were wondering what a little girl from India was doing in theirhouse. Some were pictures of children—little girls in thick satinfrocks which reached to their feet and stood out about them, and boyswith puffed sleeves and lace collars and long hair, or with big ruffsaround their necks. She always stopped to look at the children, andwonder what their names were, and where they had gone, and why they woresuch odd clothes. There was a stiff, plain little girl rather likeherself. She wore a green brocade dress and held a green parrot on herfinger. Her eyes had a sharp, curious look.""Where do you live now?"" said Mary aloud to her. ""I wish you were here.""Surely no other little girl ever spent such a queer morning. It seemedas if there was no one in all the huge rambling house but her own smallself, wandering about up-stairs and down, through narrow passages andwide ones, where it seemed to her that no one but herself had everwalked. Since so many rooms had been built, people must have lived inthem, but it all seemed so empty that she could not quite believe ittrue.It was not until she climbed to the second floor that she thought ofturning the handle of a door. All the doors were shut, as Mrs. Medlockhad said they were, but at last she put her hand on the handle of one ofthem and turned it. She was almost frightened for a moment when she feltthat it turned without difficulty and that when she pushed upon the dooritself it slowly and heavily opened. It was a massive door and openedinto a big bedroom. There were embroidered hangings on the wall, andinlaid furniture such as she had seen in India stood about the room. Abroad window with leaded panes looked out upon the moor; and over themantel was another portrait of the stiff, plain little girl who seemedto stare at her more curiously than ever.""Perhaps she slept here once,"" said Mary. ""She stares at me so that shemakes me feel queer.""After that she opened more doors and more. She saw so many rooms thatshe became quite tired and began to think that there must be a hundred,though she had not counted them. In all of them there were old picturesor old tapestries with strange scenes worked on them. There were curiouspieces of furniture and curious ornaments in nearly all of them.In one room, which looked like a lady's sitting-room, the hangings wereall embroidered velvet, and in a cabinet were about a hundred littleelephants made of ivory. They were of different sizes, and some hadtheir mahouts or palanquins on their backs. Some were much bigger thanthe others and some were so tiny that they seemed only babies. Mary hadseen carved ivory in India and she knew all about elephants. She openedthe door of the cabinet and stood on a footstool and played with thesefor quite a long time. When she got tired she set the elephants inorder and shut the door of the cabinet.In all her wanderings through the long corridors and the empty rooms,she had seen nothing alive; but in this room she saw something. Justafter she had closed the cabinet door she heard a tiny rustling sound.It made her jump and look around at the sofa by the fireplace, fromwhich it seemed to come. In the corner of the sofa there was a cushion,and in the velvet which covered it there was a hole, and out of the holepeeped a tiny head with a pair of frightened eyes in it.Mary crept softly across the room to look. The bright eyes belonged to alittle gray mouse, and the mouse had eaten a hole into the cushion andmade a comfortable nest there. Six baby mice were cuddled up asleep nearher. If there was no one else alive in the hundred rooms there wereseven mice who did not look lonely at all.""If they wouldn't be so frightened I would take them back with me,"" saidMary.She had wandered about long enough to feel too tired to wander anyfarther, and she turned back. Two or three times she lost her way byturning down the wrong corridor and was obliged to ramble up and downuntil she found the right one; but at last she reached her own flooragain, though she was some distance from her own room and did not knowexactly where she was.""I believe I have taken a wrong turning again,"" she said, standing stillat what seemed the end of a short passage with tapestry on the wall. ""Idon't know which way to go. How still everything is!""It was while she was standing here and just after she had said this thatthe stillness was broken by a sound. It was another cry, but not quitelike the one she had heard last night; it was only a short one, afretful, childish whine muffled by passing through walls.""It's nearer than it was,"" said Mary, her heart beating rather faster.""And it is crying.""She put her hand accidentally upon the tapestry near her, and thensprang back, feeling quite startled. The tapestry was the covering of adoor which fell open and showed her that there was another part of thecorridor behind it, and Mrs. Medlock was coming up it with her bunch ofkeys in her hand and a very cross look on her face.""What are you doing here?"" she said, and she took Mary by the arm andpulled her away. ""What did I tell you?""""I turned round the wrong corner,"" explained Mary. ""I didn't know whichway to go and I heard some one crying.""She quite hated Mrs. Medlock at the moment, but she hated her more thenext.""You didn't hear anything of the sort,"" said the housekeeper. ""You comealong back to your own nursery or I'll box your ears.""And she took her by the arm and half pushed, half pulled her up onepassage and down another until she pushed her in at the door of her ownroom.""Now,"" she said, ""you stay where you're told to stay or you'll findyourself locked up. The master had better get you a governess, same ashe said he would. You're one that needs some one to look sharp afteryou. I've got enough to do.""She went out of the room and slammed the door after her, and Mary wentand sat on the hearth-rug, pale with rage. She did not cry, but groundher teeth.""There was some one crying—there was—there was!"" she said toherself.She had heard it twice now, and sometime she would find out. She hadfound out a great deal this morning. She felt as if she had been on along journey, and at any rate she had had something to amuse her all thetime, and she had played with the ivory elephants and had seen the graymouse and its babies in their nest in the velvet cushion."

Look at the moor!""The rain-storm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been sweptaway in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and abrilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never hadMary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing; thiswas of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the watersof some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in thearched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. Thefar-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead ofgloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.""Aye,"" said Martha with a cheerful grin. ""Th' storm's over for a bit. Itdoes like this at this time o' th' year. It goes off in a night like itwas pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again.That's because th' springtime's on its way. It's a long way off yet, butit's comin'.""""I thought perhaps it always rained or looked dark in England,"" Marysaid.""Eh! no!"" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black leadbrushes. ""Nowt o' th' soart!""""What does that mean?"" asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spokedifferent dialects which only a few people understood, so she was notsurprised when Martha used words she did not know.Martha laughed as she had done the first morning.""There now,"" she said. ""I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs.Medlock said I mustn't. 'Nowt o' th' soart' means'nothin'-of-the-sort,'"" slowly and carefully, ""but it takes so long tosay it. Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I toldthee tha'd like th' moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see th'gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th'heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterfliesflutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'. You'llwant to get out on it at sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickondoes.""""Could I ever get there?"" asked Mary wistfully, looking through herwindow at the far-off blue. It was so new and big and wonderful and sucha heavenly color.""I don't know,"" answered Martha. ""Tha's never used tha' legs since tha'was born, it seems to me. Tha' couldn't walk five mile. It's five mileto our cottage.""""I should like to see your cottage.""Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishingbrush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that the smallplain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done thefirst morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like little SusanAnn's when she wanted something very much.""I'll ask my mother about it,"" she said. ""She's one o' them that nearlyalways sees a way to do things. It's my day out to-day an' I'm goin'home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother. Perhaps shecould talk to her.""""I like your mother,"" said Mary.""I should think tha' did,"" agreed Martha, polishing away.""I've never seen her,"" said Mary.""No, tha' hasn't,"" replied Martha.She sat up on her heels again and rubbed the end of her nose with theback of her hand as if puzzled for a moment, but she ended quitepositively.""Well, she's that sensible an' hard workin' an' good-natured an' cleanthat no one could help likin' her whether they'd seen her or not. WhenI'm goin' home to her on my day out I just jump for joy when I'mcrossin' th' moor.""""I like Dickon,"" added Mary. ""And I've never seen him.""""Well,"" said Martha stoutly, ""I've told thee that th' very birds likeshim an' th' rabbits an' wild sheep an' ponies, an' th' foxes themselves.I wonder,"" staring at her reflectively, ""what Dickon would think ofthee?""""He wouldn't like me,"" said Mary in her stiff, cold little way. ""No onedoes.""Martha looked reflective again.""How does tha' like thysel'?"" she inquired, really quite as if she werecurious to know.Mary hesitated a moment and thought it over.""Not at all—really,"" she answered. ""But I never thought of thatbefore.""Martha grinned a little as if at some homely recollection.""Mother said that to me once,"" she said. ""She was at her wash-tub an' Iwas in a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on mean' says: 'Tha' young vixon, tha'! There tha' stands sayin' tha'doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one. How does tha' likethysel'?' It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute.""She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary herbreakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to thecottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and dothe week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in thehouse. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and thefirst thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flowergarden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she hadfinished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole placelook different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite aswell as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up intoit, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of thelittle snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the firstkitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two othergardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. Hespoke to her of his own accord.""Springtime's comin',"" he said. ""Cannot tha' smell it?""Mary sniffed and thought she could.""I smell something nice and fresh and damp,"" she said.""That's th' good rich earth,"" he answered, digging away. ""It's in a goodhumor makin' ready to grow things. It's glad when plantin' time comes.It's dull in th' winter when it's got nowt to do. In th' flower gardensout there things will be stirrin' down below in th' dark. Th' sun'swarmin' 'em. You'll see bits o' green spikes stickin' out o' th' blackearth after a bit.""""What will they be?"" asked Mary.""Crocuses an' snowdrops an' daffydowndillys. Has tha' never seen them?""""No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India,""said Mary. ""And I think things grow up in a night.""""These won't grow up in a night,"" said Weatherstaff. ""Tha'll have towait for 'em. They'll poke up a bit higher here, an' push out a spikemore there, an' uncurl a leaf this day an' another that. You watch 'em.""""I am going to,"" answered Mary.Very soon she heard the soft rustling flight of wings again and she knewat once that the robin had come again. He was very pert and lively, andhopped about so close to her feet, and put his head on one side andlooked at her so slyly that she asked Ben Weatherstaff a question.""Do you think he remembers me?"" she said.""Remembers thee!"" said Weatherstaff indignantly. ""He knows every cabbagestump in th' gardens, let alone th' people. He's never seen a littlewench here before, an' he's bent on findin' out all about thee. Tha's noneed to try to hide anything from him.""""Are things stirring down below in the dark in that garden where helives?"" Mary inquired.""What garden?"" grunted Weatherstaff, becoming surly again.""The one where the old rose-trees are."" She could not help asking,because she wanted so much to know. ""Are all the flowers dead, or dosome of them come again in the summer? Are there ever any roses?""""Ask him,"" said Ben Weatherstaff, hunching his shoulders toward therobin. ""He's the only one as knows. No one else has seen inside it forten year'.""Ten years was a long time, Mary thought. She had been born ten yearsago.She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the garden justas she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother. Shewas beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people tolike—when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as oneof the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wallover which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walkedup and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, andit was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.She heard a chirp and a twitter, and when she looked at the bareflower-bed at her left side there he was hopping about and pretending topeck things out of the earth to persuade her that he had not followedher. But she knew he had followed her and the surprise so filled herwith delight that she almost trembled a little.""You do remember me!"" she cried out. ""You do! You are prettier thananything else in the world!""She chirped, and talked, and coaxed and he hopped, and flirted his tailand twittered. It was as if he were talking. His red waistcoat was likesatin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand andso pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important andlike a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that she hadever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer andcloser to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something likerobin sounds.Oh! to think that he should actually let her come as near to him asthat! He knew nothing in the world would make her put out her handtoward him or startle him in the least tiniest way. He knew it becausehe was a real person—only nicer than any other person in the world. Shewas so happy that she scarcely dared to breathe.The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because theperennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there weretall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, andas the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pileof freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a worm. Theearth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a moleand he had scratched quite a deep hole.Mary looked at it, not really knowing why the hole was there, and as shelooked she saw something almost buried in the newly-turned soil. It wassomething like a ring of rusty iron or brass and when the robin flew upinto a tree nearby she put out her hand and picked the ring up. It wasmore than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it hadbeen buried a long time.Mistress Mary stood up and looked at it with an almost frightened faceas it hung from her finger.""Perhaps it has been buried for ten years,"" she said in a whisper.""Perhaps it is the key to the garden!"""

She turned it over and over,and thought about it. As I have said before, she was not a child who hadbeen trained to ask permission or consult her elders about things. Allshe thought about the key was that if it was the key to the closedgarden, and she could find out where the door was, she could perhapsopen it and see what was inside the walls, and what had happened to theold rose-trees. It was because it had been shut up so long that shewanted to see it. It seemed as if it must be different from other placesand that something strange must have happened to it during ten years.Besides that, if she liked it she could go into it every day and shutthe door behind her, and she could make up some play of her own and playit quite alone, because nobody would ever know where she was, but wouldthink the door was still locked and the key buried in the earth. Thethought of that pleased her very much.Living as it were, all by herself in a house with a hundredmysteriously closed rooms and having nothing whatever to do to amuseherself, had set her inactive brain to working and was actuallyawakening her imagination. There is no doubt that the fresh, strong,pure air from the moor had a great deal to do with it. Just as it hadgiven her an appetite, and fighting with the wind had stirred her blood,so the same things had stirred her mind. In India she had always beentoo hot and languid and weak to care much about anything, but in thisplace she was beginning to care and to want to do new things. Alreadyshe felt less ""contrary,"" though she did not know why.She put the key in her pocket and walked up and down her walk. No onebut herself ever seemed to come there, so she could walk slowly and lookat the wall, or, rather, at the ivy growing on it. The ivy was thebaffling thing. Howsoever carefully she looked she could see nothing butthickly-growing, glossy, dark green leaves. She was very muchdisappointed. Something of her contrariness came back to her as shepaced the walk and looked over it at the tree-tops inside. It seemed sosilly, she said to herself, to be near it and not be able to get in. Shetook the key in her pocket when she went back to the house, and she madeup her mind that she would always carry it with her when she went out,so that if she ever should find the hidden door she would be ready.Mrs. Medlock had allowed Martha to sleep all night at the cottage, butshe was back at her work in the morning with cheeks redder than ever andin the best of spirits.""I got up at four o'clock,"" she said. ""Eh! it was pretty on th' moorwith th' birds gettin' up an' th' rabbits scamperin' about an' th' sunrisin'. I didn't walk all th' way. A man gave me a ride in his cart an'I can tell you I did enjoy myself.""She was full of stories of the delights of her day out. Her mother hadbeen glad to see her and they had got the baking and washing all out ofthe way. She had even made each of the children a dough-cake with a bitof brown sugar in it.""I had 'em all pipin' hot when they came in from playin' on th' moor.An' th' cottage all smelt o' nice, clean hot bakin' an' there was a goodfire, an' they just shouted for joy. Our Dickon he said our cottage wasgood enough for a king to live in.""In the evening they had all sat round the fire, and Martha and hermother had sewed patches on torn clothes and mended stockings and Marthahad told them about the little girl who had come from India and who hadbeen waited on all her life by what Martha called ""blacks"" until shedidn't know how to put on her own stockings.""Eh! they did like to hear about you,"" said Martha. ""They wanted to knowall about th' blacks an' about th' ship you came in. I couldn't tell 'emenough.""Mary reflected a little.""I'll tell you a great deal more before your next day out,"" she said,""so that you will have more to talk about. I dare say they would like tohear about riding on elephants and camels, and about the officers goingto hunt tigers.""""My word!"" cried delighted Martha. ""It would set 'em clean off theirheads. Would tha' really do that, Miss? It would be same as a wild beastshow like we heard they had in York once.""""India is quite different from Yorkshire,"" Mary said slowly, as shethought the matter over. ""I never thought of that. Did Dickon and yourmother like to hear you talk about me?""""Why, our Dickon's eyes nearly started out o' his head, they got thatround,"" answered Martha. ""But mother, she was put out about your seemin'to be all by yourself like. She said, 'Hasn't Mr. Craven got nogoverness for her, nor no nurse?' and I said, 'No, he hasn't, thoughMrs. Medlock says he will when he thinks of it, but she says he mayn'tthink of it for two or three years.'""""I don't want a governess,"" said Mary sharply.""But mother says you ought to be learnin' your book by this time an' youought to have a woman to look after you, an' she says: 'Now, Martha, youjust think how you'd feel yourself, in a big place like that, wanderin'about all alone, an' no mother. You do your best to cheer her up,' shesays, an' I said I would.""Mary gave her a long, steady look.""You do cheer me up,"" she said. ""I like to hear you talk.""Presently Martha went out of the room and came back with something heldin her hands under her apron.""What does tha' think,"" she said, with a cheerful grin. ""I've broughtthee a present.""""A present!"" exclaimed Mistress Mary. How could a cottage full offourteen hungry people give any one a present!""A man was drivin' across the moor peddlin',"" Martha explained. ""An' hestopped his cart at our door. He had pots an' pans an' odds an' ends,but mother had no money to buy anythin'. Just as he was goin' away our'Lizabeth Ellen called out, 'Mother, he's got skippin'-ropes with redan' blue handles.' An' mother she calls out quite sudden, 'Here, stop,mister! How much are they?' An' he says 'Tuppence,' an' mother shebegan fumblin' in her pocket an' she says to me, 'Martha, tha's broughtme thy wages like a good lass, an' I've got four places to put everypenny, but I'm just goin' to take tuppence out of it to buy that child askippin'-rope,' an' she bought one an' here it is.""She brought it out from under her apron and exhibited it quite proudly.It was a strong, slender rope with a striped red and blue handle at eachend, but Mary Lennox had never seen a skipping-rope before. She gazed atit with a mystified expression.""What is it for?"" she asked curiously.""For!"" cried out Martha. ""Does tha' mean that they've not gotskippin'-ropes in India, for all they've got elephants and tigers andcamels! No wonder most of 'em's black. This is what it's for; just watchme.""And she ran into the middle of the room and, taking a handle in eachhand, began to skip, and skip, and skip, while Mary turned in her chairto stare at her, and the queer faces in the old portraits seemed tostare at her, too, and wonder what on earth this common little cottagerhad the impudence to be doing under their very noses. But Martha did noteven see them. The interest and curiosity in Mistress Mary's facedelighted her, and she went on skipping and counted as she skippeduntil she had reached a hundred.""I could skip longer than that,"" she said when she stopped. ""I'veskipped as much as five hundred when I was twelve, but I wasn't as fatthen as I am now, an' I was in practice.""Mary got up from her chair beginning to feel excited herself.""It looks nice,"" she said. ""Your mother is a kind woman. Do you think Icould ever skip like that?""""You just try it,"" urged Martha, handing her the skipping-rope. ""Youcan't skip a hundred at first, but if you practise you'll mount up.That's what mother said. She says, 'Nothin' will do her more good thanskippin' rope. It's th' sensiblest toy a child can have. Let her playout in th' fresh air skippin' an' it'll stretch her legs an' arms an'give her some strength in 'em.'""It was plain that there was not a great deal of strength in MistressMary's arms and legs when she first began to skip. She was not veryclever at it, but she liked it so much that she did not want to stop.""Put on tha' things and run an' skip out o' doors,"" said Martha. ""Mothersaid I must tell you to keep out o' doors as much as you could, evenwhen it rains a bit, so as tha' wrap up warm.""Mary put on her coat and hat and took her skipping-rope over her arm.She opened the door to go out, and then suddenly thought of somethingand turned back rather slowly.""Martha,"" she said, ""they were your wages. It was your twopence really.Thank you."" She said it stiffly because she was not used to thankingpeople or noticing that they did things for her. ""Thank you,"" she said,and held out her hand because she did not know what else to do.Martha gave her hand a clumsy little shake, as if she was not accustomedto this sort of thing either. Then she laughed.""Eh! tha' art a queer, old-womanish thing,"" she said. ""If tha'd been our'Lizabeth Ellen tha'd have give me a kiss.""Mary looked stiffer than ever.""Do you want me to kiss you?""Martha laughed again.""Nay, not me,"" she answered. ""If tha' was different, p'raps tha'd wantto thysel'. But tha' isn't. Run off outside an' play with thy rope.""Mistress Mary felt a little awkward as she went out of the room.Yorkshire people seemed strange, and Martha was always rather a puzzleto her. At first she had disliked her very much, but now she did not.The skipping-rope was a wonderful thing. She counted and skipped, andskipped and counted, until her cheeks were quite red, and she was moreinterested than she had ever been since she was born. The sun wasshining and a little wind was blowing—not a rough wind, but one whichcame in delightful little gusts and brought a fresh scent of newlyturned earth with it. She skipped round the fountain garden, and up onewalk and down another. She skipped at last into the kitchen-garden andsaw Ben Weatherstaff digging and talking to his robin, which was hoppingabout him. She skipped down the walk toward him and he lifted his headand looked at her with a curious expression. She had wondered if hewould notice her. She really wanted him to see her skip.""Well!"" he exclaimed. ""Upon my word! P'raps tha' art a young 'un, afterall, an' p'raps tha's got child's blood in thy veins instead of sourbuttermilk. Tha's skipped red into thy cheeks as sure as my name's BenWeatherstaff. I wouldn't have believed tha' could do it.""""I never skipped before,"" Mary said. ""I'm just beginning. I can only goup to twenty.""""Tha' keep on,"" said Ben. ""Tha' shapes well enough at it for a young 'unthat's lived with heathen. Just see how he's watchin' thee,"" jerking hishead toward the robin. ""He followed after thee yesterday. He'll be atit again to-day. He'll be bound to find out what th' skippin'-rope is.He's never seen one. Eh!"" shaking his head at the bird, ""tha' curositywill be th' death of thee sometime if tha' doesn't look sharp.""Mary skipped round all the gardens and round the orchard, resting everyfew minutes. At length she went to her own special walk and made up hermind to try if she could skip the whole length of it. It was a good longskip and she began slowly, but before she had gone half-way down thepath she was so hot and breathless that she was obliged to stop. She didnot mind much, because she had already counted up to thirty. She stoppedwith a little laugh of pleasure, and there, lo and behold, was the robinswaying on a long branch of ivy. He had followed her and he greeted herwith a chirp. As Mary had skipped toward him she felt something heavy inher pocket strike against her at each jump, and when she saw the robinshe laughed again.""You showed me where the key was yesterday,"" she said. ""You ought toshow me the door to-day; but I don't believe you know!""The robin flew from his swinging spray of ivy on to the top of the walland he opened his beak and sang a loud, lovely trill, merely to showoff. Nothing in the world is quite as adorably lovely as a robin whenhe shows off—and they are nearly always doing it.Mary Lennox had heard a great deal about Magic in her Ayah's stories,and she always said that what happened almost at that moment was Magic.One of the nice little gusts of wind rushed down the walk, and it was astronger one than the rest. It was strong enough to wave the branches ofthe trees, and it was more than strong enough to sway the trailingsprays of untrimmed ivy hanging from the wall. Mary had stepped close tothe robin, and suddenly the gust of wind swung aside some loose ivytrails, and more suddenly still she jumped toward it and caught it inher hand. This she did because she had seen something under it—a roundknob which had been covered by the leaves hanging over it. It was theknob of a door.She put her hands under the leaves and began to pull and push themaside. Thick as the ivy hung, it nearly all was a loose and swingingcurtain, though some had crept over wood and iron. Mary's heart began tothump and her hands to shake a little in her delight and excitement. Therobin kept singing and twittering away and tilting his head on one side,as if he were as excited as she was. What was this under her hands whichwas square and made of iron and which her fingers found a hole in?It was the lock of the door which had been closed ten years and she puther hand in her pocket, drew out the key and found it fitted thekeyhole. She put the key in and turned it. It took two hands to do it,but it did turn.And then she took a long breath and looked behind her up the long walkto see if any one was coming. No one was coming. No one ever did come,it seemed, and she took another long breath, because she could not helpit, and she held back the swinging curtain of ivy and pushed back thedoor which opened slowly—slowly.Then she slipped through it, and shut it behind her, and stood with herback against it, looking about her and breathing quite fast withexcitement, and wonder, and delight.She was standing inside the secret garden."

The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leaflessstems of climbing roses which were so thick that they were mattedtogether. Mary Lennox knew they were roses because she had seen a greatmany roses in India. All the ground was covered with grass of a wintrybrown and out of it grew clumps of bushes which were surely rose-bushesif they were alive. There were numbers of standard roses which had sospread their branches that they were like little trees. There were othertrees in the garden, and one of the things which made the place lookstrangest and loveliest was that climbing roses had run all over themand swung down long tendrils which made light swaying curtains, and hereand there they had caught at each other or at a far-reaching branch andhad crept from one tree to another and made lovely bridges ofthemselves. There were neither leaves nor roses on them now and Mary didnot know whether they were dead or alive, but their thin gray or brownbranches and sprays looked like a sort of hazy mantle spreading overeverything, walls, and trees, and even brown grass, where they hadfallen from their fastenings and run along the ground. It was this hazytangle from tree to tree which made it all look so mysterious. Mary hadthought it must be different from other gardens which had not been leftall by themselves so long; and indeed it was different from any otherplace she had ever seen in her life.""How still it is!"" she whispered. ""How still!""Then she waited a moment and listened at the stillness. The robin, whohad flown to his tree-top, was still as all the rest. He did not evenflutter his wings; he sat without stirring, and looked at Mary.""No wonder it is still,"" she whispered again. ""I am the first person whohas spoken in here for ten years.""She moved away from the door, stepping as softly as if she were afraidof awakening some one. She was glad that there was grass under her feetand that her steps made no sounds. She walked under one of thefairy-like gray arches between the trees and looked up at the sprays andtendrils which formed them.""I wonder if they are all quite dead,"" she said. ""Is it all a quite deadgarden? I wish it wasn't.""If she had been Ben Weatherstaff she could have told whether the woodwas alive by looking at it, but she could only see that there were onlygray or brown sprays and branches and none showed any signs of even atiny leaf-bud anywhere.But she was inside the wonderful garden and she could come through thedoor under the ivy any time and she felt as if she had found a world allher own.The sun was shining inside the four walls and the high arch of blue skyover this particular piece of Misselthwaite seemed even more brilliantand soft than it was over the moor. The robin flew down from histree-top and hopped about or flew after her from one bush to another. Hechirped a good deal and had a very busy air, as if he were showing herthings. Everything was strange and silent and she seemed to be hundredsof miles away from any one, but somehow she did not feel lonely at all.All that troubled her was her wish that she knew whether all the roseswere dead, or if perhaps some of them had lived and might put out leavesand buds as the weather got warmer. She did not want it to be a quitedead garden. If it were a quite alive garden, how wonderful it wouldbe, and what thousands of roses would grow on every side!Her skipping-rope had hung over her arm when she came in and after shehad walked about for a while she thought she would skip round the wholegarden, stopping when she wanted to look at things. There seemed to havebeen grass paths here and there, and in one or two corners there werealcoves of evergreen with stone seats or tall moss-covered flower urnsin them.As she came near the second of these alcoves she stopped skipping. Therehad once been a flower-bed in it, and she thought she saw somethingsticking out of the black earth—some sharp little pale green points.She remembered what Ben Weatherstaff had said and she knelt down to lookat them.""Yes, they are tiny growing things and they might be crocuses orsnowdrops or daffodils,"" she whispered.She bent very close to them and sniffed the fresh scent of the dampearth. She liked it very much.""Perhaps there are some other ones coming up in other places,"" she said.""I will go all over the garden and look.""She did not skip, but walked. She went slowly and kept her eyes on theground. She looked in the old border beds and among the grass, and aftershe had gone round, trying to miss nothing, she had found ever so manymore sharp, pale green points, and she had become quite excited again.""It isn't a quite dead garden,"" she cried out softly to herself. ""Evenif the roses are dead, there are other things alive.""She did not know anything about gardening, but the grass seemed so thickin some of the places where the green points were pushing their waythrough that she thought they did not seem to have room enough to grow.She searched about until she found a rather sharp piece of wood andknelt down and dug and weeded out the weeds and grass until she madenice little clear places around them.""Now they look as if they could breathe,"" she said, after she hadfinished with the first ones. ""I am going to do ever so many more. I'lldo all I can see. If I haven't time to-day I can come to-morrow.""She went from place to place, and dug and weeded, and enjoyed herself soimmensely that she was led on from bed to bed and into the grass underthe trees. The exercise made her so warm that she first threw her coatoff, and then her hat, and without knowing it she was smiling down on tothe grass and the pale green points all the time.The robin was tremendously busy. He was very much pleased to seegardening begun on his own estate. He had often wondered at BenWeatherstaff. Where gardening is done all sorts of delightful things toeat are turned up with the soil. Now here was this new kind of creaturewho was not half Ben's size and yet had had the sense to come into hisgarden and begin at once.Mistress Mary worked in her garden until it was time to go to her middaydinner. In fact, she was rather late in remembering, and when she put onher coat and hat, and picked up her skipping-rope, she could not believethat she had been working two or three hours. She had been actuallyhappy all the time; and dozens and dozens of the tiny, pale green pointswere to be seen in cleared places, looking twice as cheerful as they hadlooked before when the grass and weeds had been smothering them.""I shall come back this afternoon,"" she said, looking all round at hernew kingdom, and speaking to the trees and the rose-bushes as if theyheard her.Then she ran lightly across the grass, pushed open the slow old door andslipped through it under the ivy. She had such red cheeks and suchbright eyes and ate such a dinner that Martha was delighted.""Two pieces o' meat an' two helps o' rice puddin'!"" she said. ""Eh!mother will be pleased when I tell her what th' skippin'-rope's donefor thee.""In the course of her digging with her pointed stick Mistress Mary hadfound herself digging up a sort of white root rather like an onion. Shehad put it back in its place and patted the earth carefully down on itand just now she wondered if Martha could tell her what it was.""Martha,"" she said, ""what are those white roots that look like onions?""""They're bulbs,"" answered Martha. ""Lots o' spring flowers grow from 'em.Th' very little ones are snowdrops an' crocuses an' th' big ones arenarcissusis an' jonquils an' daffydowndillys. Th' biggest of all islilies an' purple flags. Eh! they are nice. Dickon's got a whole lot of'em planted in our bit o' garden.""""Does Dickon know all about them?"" asked Mary, a new idea takingpossession of her.""Our Dickon can make a flower grow out of a brick walk. Mother says hejust whispers things out o' th' ground.""""Do bulbs live a long time? Would they live years and years if no onehelped them?"" inquired Mary anxiously.""They're things as helps themselves,"" said Martha. ""That's why poor folkcan afford to have 'em. If you don't trouble 'em, most of 'em'll workaway underground for a lifetime an' spread out an' have little 'uns.There's a place in th' park woods here where there's snowdrops bythousands. They're the prettiest sight in Yorkshire when th' springcomes. No one knows when they was first planted.""""I wish the spring was here now,"" said Mary. ""I want to see all thethings that grow in England.""She had finished her dinner and gone to her favorite seat on thehearth-rug.""I wish—I wish I had a little spade,"" she said.""Whatever does tha' want a spade for?"" asked Martha, laughing. ""Art tha'goin' to take to diggin'? I must tell mother that, too.""Mary looked at the fire and pondered a little. She must be careful ifshe meant to keep her secret kingdom. She wasn't doing any harm, but ifMr. Craven found out about the open door he would be fearfully angry andget a new key and lock it up forevermore. She really could not bearthat.""This is such a big lonely place,"" she said slowly, as if she wereturning matters over in her mind. ""The house is lonely, and the park islonely, and the gardens are lonely. So many places seem shut up. I neverdid many things in India, but there were more people to look at—nativesand soldiers marching by—and sometimes bands playing, and my Ayah toldme stories. There is no one to talk to here except you and BenWeatherstaff. And you have to do your work and Ben Weatherstaff won'tspeak to me often. I thought if I had a little spade I could digsomewhere as he does, and I might make a little garden if he would giveme some seeds.""Martha's face quite lighted up.""There now!"" she exclaimed, ""if that wasn't one of th' things mothersaid. She says, 'There's such a lot o' room in that big place, why don'tthey give her a bit for herself, even if she doesn't plant nothin' butparsley an' radishes? She'd dig an' rake away an' be right down happyover it.' Them was the very words she said.""""Were they?"" said Mary. ""How many things she knows, doesn't she?""""Eh!"" said Martha. ""It's like she says: 'A woman as brings up twelvechildren learns something besides her A B C. Children's as good as'rithmetic to set you findin' out things.'""""How much would a spade cost—a little one?"" Mary asked.""Well,"" was Martha's reflective answer, ""at Thwaite village there's ashop or so an' I saw little garden sets with a spade an' a rake an' afork all tied together for two shillings. An' they was stout enough towork with, too.""""I've got more than that in my purse,"" said Mary. ""Mrs. Morrison gaveme five shillings and Mrs. Medlock gave me some money from Mr. Craven.""""Did he remember thee that much?"" exclaimed Martha.""Mrs. Medlock said I was to have a shilling a week to spend. She givesme one every Saturday. I didn't know what to spend it on.""""My word! that's riches,"" said Martha. ""Tha' can buy anything in th'world tha' wants. Th' rent of our cottage is only one an' threepence an'it's like pullin' eye-teeth to get it. Now I've just thought ofsomethin',"" putting her hands on her hips.""What?"" said Mary eagerly.""In the shop at Thwaite they sell packages o' flower-seeds for a pennyeach, and our Dickon he knows which is th' prettiest ones an' how tomake 'em grow. He walks over to Thwaite many a day just for th' fun ofit. Does tha' know how to print letters?"" suddenly.""I know how to write,"" Mary answered.Martha shook her head.""Our Dickon can only read printin'. If tha' could print we could write aletter to him an' ask him to go an' buy th' garden tools an' th' seedsat th' same time.""""Oh! you're a good girl!"" Mary cried. ""You are, really! I didn't knowyou were so nice. I know I can print letters if I try. Let's ask Mrs.Medlock for a pen and ink and some paper.""""I've got some of my own,"" said Martha. ""I bought 'em so I could print abit of a letter to mother of a Sunday. I'll go and get it.""She ran out of the room, and Mary stood by the fire and twisted her thinlittle hands together with sheer pleasure.""If I have a spade,"" she whispered, ""I can make the earth nice and softand dig up weeds. If I have seeds and can make flowers grow the gardenwon't be dead at all—it will come alive.""She did not go out again that afternoon because when Martha returnedwith her pen and ink and paper she was obliged to clear the table andcarry the plates and dishes down-stairs and when she got into thekitchen Mrs. Medlock was there and told her to do something, so Marywaited for what seemed to her a long time before she came back. Then itwas a serious piece of work to write to Dickon. Mary had been taughtvery little because her governesses had disliked her too much to staywith her. She could not spell particularly well but she found that shecould print letters when she tried. This was the letter Martha dictatedto her:""We'll put the money in th' envelope an' I'll get th' butcher's boy totake it in his cart. He's a great friend o' Dickon's,"" said Martha.""How shall I get the things when Dickon buys them?"" asked Mary.""He'll bring 'em to you himself. He'll like to walk over this way.""""Oh!"" exclaimed Mary, ""then I shall see him! I never thought I shouldsee Dickon.""""Does tha' want to see him?"" asked Martha suddenly, she had looked sopleased.""Yes, I do. I never saw a boy foxes and crows loved. I want to see himvery much.""Martha gave a little start, as if she suddenly remembered something.""Now to think,"" she broke out, ""to think o' me forgettin' that there;an' I thought I was goin' to tell you first thing this mornin'. I askedmother—and she said she'd ask Mrs. Medlock her own self.""""Do you mean—"" Mary began.""What I said Tuesday. Ask her if you might be driven over to our cottagesome day and have a bit o' mother's hot oat cake, an' butter, an' aglass o' milk.""It seemed as if all the interesting things were happening in one day. Tothink of going over the moor in the daylight and when the sky was blue!To think of going into the cottage which held twelve children!""Does she think Mrs. Medlock would let me go?"" she asked, quiteanxiously.""Aye, she thinks she would. She knows what a tidy woman mother is andhow clean she keeps the cottage.""""If I went I should see your mother as well as Dickon,"" said Mary,thinking it over and liking the idea very much. ""She doesn't seem to belike the mothers in India.""Her work in the garden and the excitement of the afternoon ended bymaking her feel quiet and thoughtful. Martha stayed with her untiltea-time, but they sat in comfortable quiet and talked very little. Butjust before Martha went down-stairs for the tea-tray, Mary asked aquestion.""Martha,"" she said, ""has the scullery-maid had the toothache againto-day?""Martha certainly started slightly.""What makes thee ask that?"" she said.""Because when I waited so long for you to come back I opened the doorand walked down the corridor to see if you were coming. And I heard thatfar-off crying again, just as we heard it the other night. There isn't awind to-day, so you see it couldn't have been the wind.""""Eh!"" said Martha restlessly. ""Tha' mustn't go walkin' about incorridors an' listenin'. Mr. Craven would be that there angry there's noknowin' what he'd do.""""I wasn't listening,"" said Mary. ""I was just waiting for you—and Iheard it. That's three times.""""My word! There's Mrs. Medlock's bell,"" said Martha, and she almost ranout of the room.""It's the strangest house any one ever lived in,"" said Mary drowsily, asshe dropped her head on the cushioned seat of the armchair near her.Fresh air, and digging, and skipping-rope had made her feel socomfortably tired that she fell asleep."

The SecretGarden was what Mary called it when she was thinking of it. She likedthe name, and she liked still more the feeling that when its beautifulold walls shut her in no one knew where she was. It seemed almost likebeing shut out of the world in some fairy place. The few books she hadread and liked had been fairy-story books, and she had read of secretgardens in some of the stories. Sometimes people went to sleep in themfor a hundred years, which she had thought must be rather stupid. Shehad no intention of going to sleep, and, in fact, she was becoming widerawake every day which passed at Misselthwaite. She was beginning to liketo be out of doors; she no longer hated the wind, but enjoyed it. Shecould run faster, and longer, and she could skip up to a hundred. Thebulbs in the secret garden must have been much astonished. Such niceclear places were made round them that they had all the breathing spacethey wanted, and really, if Mistress Mary had known it, they began tocheer up under the dark earth and work tremendously. The sun could getat them and warm them, and when the rain came down it could reach themat once, so they began to feel very much alive.Mary was an odd, determined little person, and now she had somethinginteresting to be determined about, she was very much absorbed, indeed.She worked and dug and pulled up weeds steadily, only becoming morepleased with her work every hour instead of tiring of it. It seemed toher like a fascinating sort of play. She found many more of thesprouting pale green points than she had ever hoped to find. They seemedto be starting up everywhere and each day she was sure she found tinynew ones, some so tiny that they barely peeped above the earth. Therewere so many that she remembered what Martha had said about the""snowdrops by the thousands,"" and about bulbs spreading and making newones. These had been left to themselves for ten years and perhaps theyhad spread, like the snowdrops, into thousands. She wondered how long itwould be before they showed that they were flowers. Sometimes shestopped digging to look at the garden and try to imagine what it wouldbe like when it was covered with thousands of lovely things in bloom.During that week of sunshine, she became more intimate with BenWeatherstaff. She surprised him several times by seeming to start upbeside him as if she sprang out of the earth. The truth was that she wasafraid that he would pick up his tools and go away if he saw her coming,so she always walked toward him as silently as possible. But, in fact,he did not object to her as strongly as he had at first. Perhaps he wassecretly rather flattered by her evident desire for his elderly company.Then, also, she was more civil than she had been. He did not know thatwhen she first saw him she spoke to him as she would have spoken to anative, and had not known that a cross, sturdy old Yorkshire man was notaccustomed to salaam to his masters, and be merely commanded by them todo things.""Tha'rt like th' robin,"" he said to her one morning when he lifted hishead and saw her standing by him. ""I never knows when I shall see theeor which side tha'll come from.""""He's friends with me now,"" said Mary.""That's like him,"" snapped Ben Weatherstaff. ""Makin' up to th' womenfolk just for vanity an' flightiness. There's nothin' he wouldn't do forth' sake o' showin' off an' flirtin' his tail-feathers. He's as full o'pride as an egg's full o' meat.""He very seldom talked much and sometimes did not even answer Mary'squestions except by a grunt, but this morning he said more than usual.He stood up and rested one hobnailed boot on the top of his spade whilehe looked her over.""How long has tha' been here?"" he jerked out.""I think it's about a month,"" she answered.""Tha's beginnin' to do Misselthwaite credit,"" he said. ""Tha's a bitfatter than tha' was an' tha's not quite so yeller. Tha' looked like ayoung plucked crow when tha' first came into this garden. Thinks I tomyself I never set eyes on an uglier, sourer faced young 'un.""Mary was not vain and as she had never thought much of her looks she wasnot greatly disturbed.""I know I'm fatter,"" she said. ""My stockings are getting tighter. Theyused to make wrinkles. There's the robin, Ben Weatherstaff.""There, indeed, was the robin, and she thought he looked nicer than ever.His red waistcoat was as glossy as satin and he flirted his wings andtail and tilted his head and hopped about with all sorts of livelygraces. He seemed determined to make Ben Weatherstaff admire him. ButBen was sarcastic.""Aye, there tha' art!"" he said. ""Tha' can put up with me for a bitsometimes when tha's got no one better. Tha's been reddinin' up thywaistcoat an' polishin' thy feathers this two weeks. I know what tha'sup to. Tha's courtin' some bold young madam somewhere, tellin' thy liesto her about bein' th' finest cock robin on Missel Moor an' ready tofight all th' rest of 'em.""""Oh! look at him!"" exclaimed Mary.The robin was evidently in a fascinating, bold mood. He hopped closerand closer and looked at Ben Weatherstaff more and more engagingly. Heflew on to the nearest currant bush and tilted his head and sang alittle song right at him.""Tha' thinks tha'll get over me by doin' that,"" said Ben, wrinkling hisface up in such a way that Mary felt sure he was trying not to lookpleased. ""Tha' thinks no one can stand out against thee—that's whattha' thinks.""The robin spread his wings—Mary could scarcely believe her eyes. Heflew right up to the handle of Ben Weatherstaff's spade and alighted onthe top of it. Then the old man's face wrinkled itself slowly into a newexpression. He stood still as if he were afraid to breathe—as if hewould not have stirred for the world, lest his robin should start away.He spoke quite in a whisper.""Well, I'm danged!"" he said as softly as if he were saying somethingquite different. ""Tha' does know how to get at a chap—tha' does! Tha'sfair unearthly, tha's so knowin'.""And he stood without stirring—almost without drawing his breath—untilthe robin gave another flirt to his wings and flew away. Then he stoodlooking at the handle of the spade as if there might be Magic in it, andthen he began to dig again and said nothing for several minutes.But because he kept breaking into a slow grin now and then, Mary was notafraid to talk to him.""Have you a garden of your own?"" she asked.""No. I'm bachelder an' lodge with Martin at th' gate.""""If you had one,"" said Mary, ""what would you plant?""""Cabbages an' 'taters an' onions.""""But if you wanted to make a flower garden,"" persisted Mary, ""what wouldyou plant?""""Bulbs an' sweet-smellin' things—but mostly roses.""Mary's face lighted up.""Do you like roses?"" she said.Ben Weatherstaff rooted up a weed and threw it aside before he answered.""Well, yes, I do. I was learned that by a young lady I was gardener to.She had a lot in a place she was fond of, an' she loved 'em like theywas children—or robins. I've seen her bend over an' kiss 'em."" Hedragged out another weed and scowled at it. ""That were as much as tenyear' ago.""""Where is she now?"" asked Mary, much interested.""Heaven,"" he answered, and drove his spade deep into the soil, ""'cordingto what parson says.""""What happened to the roses?"" Mary asked again, more interested thanever.""They was left to themselves.""Mary was becoming quite excited.""Did they quite die? Do roses quite die when they are left tothemselves?"" she ventured.""Well, I'd got to like 'em—an' I liked her—an' she liked 'em,"" BenWeatherstaff admitted reluctantly. ""Once or twice a year I'd go an' workat 'em a bit—prune 'em an' dig about th' roots. They run wild, but theywas in rich soil, so some of 'em lived.""""When they have no leaves and look gray and brown and dry, how can youtell whether they are dead or alive?"" inquired Mary.""Wait till th' spring gets at 'em—wait till th' sun shines on th' rainan' th' rain falls on th' sunshine an' then tha'll find out.""""How—how?"" cried Mary, forgetting to be careful.""Look along th' twigs an' branches an' if tha' sees a bit of a brownlump swelling here an' there, watch it after th' warm rain an' see whathappens."" He stopped suddenly and looked curiously at her eager face.""Why does tha' care so much about roses an' such, all of a sudden?"" hedemanded.Mistress Mary felt her face grow red. She was almost afraid to answer.""I—I want to play that—that I have a garden of my own,"" she stammered.""I—there is nothing for me to do. I have nothing—and no one.""""Well,"" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly, as he watched her, ""that's true.Tha' hasn't.""He said it in such an odd way that Mary wondered if he was actually alittle sorry for her. She had never felt sorry for herself; she had onlyfelt tired and cross, because she disliked people and things so much.But now the world seemed to be changing and getting nicer. If no onefound out about the secret garden, she should enjoy herself always.She stayed with him for ten or fifteen minutes longer and asked him asmany questions as she dared. He answered every one of them in his queergrunting way and he did not seem really cross and did not pick up hisspade and leave her. He said something about roses just as she wasgoing away and it reminded her of the ones he had said he had been fondof.""Do you go and see those other roses now?"" she asked.""Not been this year. My rheumatics has made me too stiff in th' joints.""He said it in his grumbling voice, and then quite suddenly he seemed toget angry with her, though she did not see why he should.""Now look here!"" he said sharply. ""Don't tha' ask so many questions.Tha'rt th' worst wench for askin' questions I've ever come across. Getthee gone an' play thee. I've done talkin' for to-day.""And he said it so crossly that she knew there was not the least use instaying another minute. She went skipping slowly down the outside walk,thinking him over and saying to herself that, queer as it was, here wasanother person whom she liked in spite of his crossness. She liked oldBen Weatherstaff. Yes, she did like him. She always wanted to try tomake him talk to her. Also she began to believe that he knew everythingin the world about flowers.There was a laurel-hedged walk which curved round the secret garden andended at a gate which opened into a wood, in the park. She thought shewould skip round this walk and look into the wood and see if there wereany rabbits hopping about. She enjoyed the skipping very much and whenshe reached the little gate she opened it and went through because sheheard a low, peculiar whistling sound and wanted to find out what itwas.It was a very strange thing indeed. She quite caught her breath as shestopped to look at it. A boy was sitting under a tree, with his backagainst it, playing on a rough wooden pipe. He was a funny looking boyabout twelve. He looked very clean and his nose turned up and his cheekswere as red as poppies and never had Mistress Mary seen such round andsuch blue eyes in any boy's face. And on the trunk of the tree he leanedagainst, a brown squirrel was clinging and watching him, and from behinda bush nearby a cock pheasant was delicately stretching his neck to peepout, and quite near him were two rabbits sitting up and sniffing withtremulous noses—and actually it appeared as if they were all drawingnear to watch him and listen to the strange low little call his pipeseemed to make.When he saw Mary he held up his hand and spoke to her in a voice almostas low as and rather like his piping.""Don't tha' move,"" he said. ""It'd flight 'em.""Mary remained motionless. He stopped playing his pipe and began to risefrom the ground. He moved so slowly that it scarcely seemed as though hewere moving at all, but at last he stood on his feet and then thesquirrel scampered back up into the branches of his tree, the pheasantwithdrew his head and the rabbits dropped on all fours and began to hopaway, though not at all as if they were frightened.""I'm Dickon,"" the boy said. ""I know tha'rt Miss Mary.""Then Mary realized that somehow she had known at first that he wasDickon. Who else could have been charming rabbits and pheasants as thenatives charm snakes in India? He had a wide, red, curving mouth and hissmile spread all over his face.""I got up slow,"" he explained, ""because if tha' makes a quick move itstartles 'em. A body 'as to move gentle an' speak low when wild thingsis about.""He did not speak to her as if they had never seen each other before butas if he knew her quite well. Mary knew nothing about boys and she spoketo him a little stiffly because she felt rather shy.""Did you get Martha's letter?"" she asked.He nodded his curly, rust-colored head.""That's why I come.""He stooped to pick up something which had been lying on the groundbeside him when he piped.""I've got th' garden tools. There's a little spade an' rake an' a forkan' hoe. Eh! they are good 'uns. There's a trowel, too. An' th' woman inth' shop threw in a packet o' white poppy an' one o' blue larkspur whenI bought th' other seeds.""""Will you show the seeds to me?"" Mary said.She wished she could talk as he did. His speech was so quick and easy.It sounded as if he liked her and was not the least afraid she would notlike him, though he was only a common moor boy, in patched clothes andwith a funny face and a rough, rusty-red head. As she came closer to himshe noticed that there was a clean fresh scent of heather and grass andleaves about him, almost as if he were made of them. She liked it verymuch and when she looked into his funny face with the red cheeks andround blue eyes she forgot that she had felt shy.""Let us sit down on this log and look at them,"" she said.They sat down and he took a clumsy little brown paper package out of hiscoat pocket. He untied the string and inside there were ever so manyneater and smaller packages with a picture of a flower on each one.""There's a lot o' mignonette an' poppies,"" he said. ""Mignonette's th'sweetest smellin' thing as grows, an' it'll grow wherever you cast it,same as poppies will. Them as'll come up an' bloom if you just whistleto 'em, them's th' nicest of all.""He stopped and turned his head quickly, his poppy-cheeked face lightingup.""Where's that robin as is callin' us?"" he said.The chirp came from a thick holly bush, bright with scarlet berries, andMary thought she knew whose it was.""Is it really calling us?"" she asked.""Aye,"" said Dickon, as if it was the most natural thing in the world,""he's callin' some one he's friends with. That's same as sayin' 'Here Iam. Look at me. I wants a bit of a chat.' There he is in the bush. Whoseis he?""""He's Ben Weatherstaff's, but I think he knows me a little,"" answeredMary.""Aye, he knows thee,"" said Dickon in his low voice again. ""An' he likesthee. He's took thee on. He'll tell me all about thee in a minute.""He moved quite close to the bush with the slow movement Mary had noticedbefore, and then he made a sound almost like the robin's own twitter.The robin listened a few seconds, intently, and then answered quite asif he were replying to a question.""Aye, he's a friend o' yours,"" chuckled Dickon.""Do you think he is?"" cried Mary eagerly. She did so want to know. ""Doyou think he really likes me?""""He wouldn't come near thee if he didn't,"" answered Dickon. ""Birds israre choosers an' a robin can flout a body worse than a man. See, he'smaking up to thee now. 'Cannot tha' see a chap?' he's sayin'.""And it really seemed as if it must be true. He so sidled and twitteredand tilted as he hopped on his bush.""Do you understand everything birds say?"" said Mary.Dickon's grin spread until he seemed all wide, red, curving mouth, andhe rubbed his rough head.""I think I do, and they think I do,"" he said. ""I've lived on th' moorwith 'em so long. I've watched 'em break shell an' come out an' fledgean' learn to fly an' begin to sing, till I think I'm one of 'em.Sometimes I think p'raps I'm a bird, or a fox, or a rabbit, or asquirrel, or even a beetle, an' I don't know it.""He laughed and came back to the log and began to talk about the flowerseeds again. He told her what they looked like when they were flowers;he told her how to plant them, and watch them, and feed and water them.""See here,"" he said suddenly, turning round to look at her. ""I'll plantthem for thee myself. Where is tha' garden?""Mary's thin hands clutched each other as they lay on her lap. She didnot know what to say, so for a whole minute she said nothing. She hadnever thought of this. She felt miserable. And she felt as if she wentred and then pale.""Tha's got a bit o' garden, hasn't tha'?"" Dickon said.It was true that she had turned red and then pale. Dickon saw her do it,and as she still said nothing, he began to be puzzled.""Wouldn't they give thee a bit?"" he asked. ""Hasn't tha' got any yet?""She held her hands even tighter and turned her eyes toward him.""I don't know anything about boys,"" she said slowly. ""Could you keep asecret, if I told you one? It's a great secret. I don't know what Ishould do if any one found it out. I believe I should die!"" She said thelast sentence quite fiercely.Dickon looked more puzzled than ever and even rubbed his hand over hisrough head again, but he answered quite good-humoredly.""I'm keepin' secrets all th' time,"" he said. ""If I couldn't keep secretsfrom th' other lads, secrets about foxes' cubs, an' birds' nests, an'wild things' holes, there'd be naught safe on th' moor. Aye, I can keepsecrets.""Mistress Mary did not mean to put out her hand and clutch his sleeve butshe did it.""I've stolen a garden,"" she said very fast. ""It isn't mine. It isn'tanybody's. Nobody wants it, nobody cares for it, nobody ever goes intoit. Perhaps everything is dead in it already; I don't know.""She began to feel hot and as contrary as she had ever felt in her life.""I don't care, I don't care! Nobody has any right to take it from mewhen I care about it and they don't. They're letting it die, all shut inby itself,"" she ended passionately, and she threw her arms over her faceand burst out crying—poor little Mistress Mary.Dickon's curious blue eyes grew rounder and rounder.""Eh-h-h!"" he said, drawing his exclamation out slowly, and the way hedid it meant both wonder and sympathy.""I've nothing to do,"" said Mary. ""Nothing belongs to me. I found itmyself and I got into it myself. I was only just like the robin, andthey wouldn't take it from the robin.""""Where is it?"" asked Dickon in a dropped voice.Mistress Mary got up from the log at once. She knew she felt contraryagain, and obstinate, and she did not care at all. She was imperious andIndian, and at the same time hot and sorrowful.""Come with me and I'll show you,"" she said.She led him round the laurel path and to the walk where the ivy grew sothickly. Dickon followed her with a queer, almost pitying, look on hisface. He felt as if he were being led to look at some strange bird'snest and must move softly. When she stepped to the wall and lifted thehanging ivy he started. There was a door and Mary pushed it slowly openand they passed in together, and then Mary stood and waved her handround defiantly.""It's this,"" she said. ""It's a secret garden, and I'm the only one inthe world who wants it to be alive.""Dickon looked round and round about it, and round and round again.""Eh!"" he almost whispered, ""it is a queer, pretty place! It's like as ifa body was in a dream."""

I forgot!"" said Mary, feeling frightened and putting her handquickly against her mouth. ""Did you know about the garden?"" she askedagain when she had recovered herself.Dickon nodded.""Martha told me there was one as no one ever went inside,"" he answered.""Us used to wonder what it was like.""He stopped and looked round at the lovely gray tangle about him, and hisround eyes looked queerly happy.""Eh! the nests as'll be here come springtime,"" he said. ""It'd be th'safest nestin' place in England. No one never comin' near an' tangles o'trees an' roses to build in. I wonder all th' birds on th' moor don'tbuild here.""Mistress Mary put her hand on his arm again without knowing it.""Will there be roses?"" she whispered. ""Can you tell? I thought perhapsthey were all dead.""""Eh! No! Not them—not all of 'em!"" he answered. ""Look here!""He stepped over to the nearest tree—an old, old one with gray lichenall over its bark, but upholding a curtain of tangled sprays andbranches. He took a thick knife out of his pocket and opened one of itsblades.""There's lots o' dead wood as ought to be cut out,"" he said. ""An'there's a lot o' old wood, but it made some new last year. This here's anew bit,"" and he touched a shoot which looked brownish green instead ofhard, dry gray.Mary touched it herself in an eager, reverent way.""That one?"" she said. ""Is that one quite alive—quite?""Dickon curved his wide smiling mouth.""It's as wick as you or me,"" he said; and Mary remembered that Marthahad told her that ""wick"" meant ""alive"" or ""lively.""""I'm glad it's wick!"" she cried out in her whisper. ""I want them all tobe wick. Let us go round the garden and count how many wick ones thereare.""She quite panted with eagerness, and Dickon was as eager as she was.They went from tree to tree and from bush to bush. Dickon carried hisknife in his hand and showed her things which she thought wonderful.""They've run wild,"" he said, ""but th' strongest ones has fair thrived onit. The delicatest ones has died out, but th' others has growed an'growed, an' spread an' spread, till they's a wonder. See here!"" and hepulled down a thick gray, dry-looking branch. ""A body might think thiswas dead wood, but I don't believe it is—down to th' root. I'll cut itlow down an' see.""He knelt and with his knife cut the lifeless-looking branch through, notfar above the earth.""There!"" he said exultantly. ""I told thee so. There's green in thatwood yet. Look at it.""Mary was down on her knees before he spoke, gazing with all her might.""When it looks a bit greenish an' juicy like that, it's wick,"" heexplained. ""When th' inside is dry an' breaks easy, like this here pieceI've cut off, it's done for. There's a big root here as all this livewood sprung out of, an' if th' old wood's cut off an' it's dug round,an' took care of there'll be—"" he stopped and lifted his face to lookup at the climbing and hanging sprays above him—""there'll be a fountaino' roses here this summer.""They went from bush to bush and from tree to tree. He was very strongand clever with his knife and knew how to cut the dry and dead woodaway, and could tell when an unpromising bough or twig had still greenlife in it. In the course of half an hour Mary thought she could telltoo, and when he cut through a lifeless-looking branch she would cry outjoyfully under her breath when she caught sight of the least shade ofmoist green. The spade, and hoe, and fork were very useful. He showedher how to use the fork while he dug about roots with the spade andstirred the earth and let the air in.They were working industriously round one of the biggest standard roseswhen he caught sight of something which made him utter an exclamation ofsurprise.""Why!"" he cried, pointing to the grass a few feet away. ""Who did thatthere?""It was one of Mary's own little clearings round the pale green points.""I did it,"" said Mary.""Why, I thought tha' didn't know nothin' about gardenin',"" he exclaimed.""I don't,"" she answered, ""but they were so little, and the grass was sothick and strong, and they looked as if they had no room to breathe. SoI made a place for them. I don't even know what they are.""Dickon went and knelt down by them, smiling his wide smile.""Tha' was right,"" he said. ""A gardener couldn't have told thee better.They'll grow now like Jack's bean-stalk. They're crocuses an' snowdrops,an' these here is narcissuses,"" turning to another patch, ""an' here'sdaffydowndillys. Eh! they will be a sight.""He ran from one clearing to another.""Tha' has done a lot o' work for such a little wench,"" he said, lookingher over.""I'm growing fatter,"" said Mary, ""and I'm growing stronger. I usedalways to be tired. When I dig I'm not tired at all. I like to smellthe earth when it's turned up.""""It's rare good for thee,"" he said, nodding his head wisely. ""There'snaught as nice as th' smell o' good clean earth, except th' smell o'fresh growin' things when th' rain falls on 'em. I get out on th' moormany a day when it's rainin' an' I lie under a bush an' listen to th'soft swish o' drops on th' heather an' I just sniff an' sniff. My noseend fair quivers like a rabbit's, mother says.""""Do you never catch cold?"" inquired Mary, gazing at him wonderingly. Shehad never seen such a funny boy, or such a nice one.""Not me,"" he said, grinning. ""I never ketched cold since I was born. Iwasn't brought up nesh enough. I've chased about th' moor in allweathers same as th' rabbits does. Mother says I've sniffed up too muchfresh air for twelve year' to ever get to sniffin' with cold. I'm astough as a white-thorn knobstick.""He was working all the time he was talking and Mary was following himand helping him with her fork or the trowel.""There's a lot of work to do here!"" he said once, looking about quiteexultantly.""Will you come again and help me to do it?"" Mary begged. ""I'm sure I canhelp, too. I can dig and pull up weeds, and do whatever you tell me.Oh! do come, Dickon!""""I'll come every day if tha' wants me, rain or shine,"" he answeredstoutly. ""It's th' best fun I ever had in my life—shut in here an'wakenin' up a garden.""""If you will come,"" said Mary, ""if you will help me to make it aliveI'll—I don't know what I'll do,"" she ended helplessly. What could youdo for a boy like that?""I'll tell thee what tha'll do,"" said Dickon, with his happy grin.""Tha'll get fat an' tha'll get as hungry as a young fox an' tha'll learnhow to talk to th' robin same as I do. Eh! we'll have a lot o' fun.""He began to walk about, looking up in the trees and at the walls andbushes with a thoughtful expression.""I wouldn't want to make it look like a gardener's garden, all clippedan' spick an' span, would you?"" he said. ""It's nicer like this withthings runnin' wild, an' swingin' an' catchin' hold of each other.""""Don't let us make it tidy,"" said Mary anxiously. ""It wouldn't seem likea secret garden if it was tidy.""Dickon stood rubbing his rusty-red head with a rather puzzled look.""It's a secret garden sure enough,"" he said, ""but seems like some onebesides th' robin must have been in it since it was shut up ten year'ago.""""But the door was locked and the key was buried,"" said Mary. ""No onecould get in.""""That's true,"" he answered. ""It's a queer place. Seems to me as ifthere'd been a bit o' prunin' done here an' there, later than ten year'ago.""""But how could it have been done?"" said Mary.He was examining a branch of a standard rose and he shook his head.""Aye! how could it!"" he murmured. ""With th' door locked an' th' keyburied.""Mistress Mary always felt that however many years she lived she shouldnever forget that first morning when her garden began to grow. Ofcourse, it did seem to begin to grow for her that morning. When Dickonbegan to clear places to plant seeds, she remembered what Basil had sungat her when he wanted to tease her.""Are there any flowers that look like bells?"" she inquired.""Lilies o' th' valley does,"" he answered, digging away with the trowel,""an' there's Canterbury bells, an' campanulas.""""Let us plant some,"" said Mary.""There's lilies o' th' valley here already; I saw 'em. They'll havegrowed too close an' we'll have to separate 'em, but there's plenty. Th'other ones takes two years to bloom from seed, but I can bring you somebits o' plants from our cottage garden. Why does tha' want 'em?""Then Mary told him about Basil and his brothers and sisters in India andof how she had hated them and of their calling her ""Mistress Mary QuiteContrary.""""They used to dance round and sing at me. They sang—I just remembered it and it made me wonder if there were really flowerslike silver bells.""She frowned a little and gave her trowel a rather spiteful dig into theearth.""I wasn't as contrary as they were.""But Dickon laughed.""Eh!"" he said, and as he crumbled the rich black soil she saw he wassniffing up the scent of it, ""there doesn't seem to be no need for noone to be contrary when there's flowers an' such like, an' such lots o'friendly wild things runnin' about makin' homes for themselves, orbuildin' nests an' singin' an' whistlin', does there?""Mary, kneeling by him holding the seeds, looked at him and stoppedfrowning.""Dickon,"" she said. ""You are as nice as Martha said you were. I likeyou, and you make the fifth person. I never thought I should like fivepeople.""Dickon sat up on his heels as Martha did when she was polishing thegrate. He did look funny and delightful, Mary thought, with his roundblue eyes and red cheeks and happy looking turned-up nose.""Only five folk as tha' likes?"" he said. ""Who is th' other four?""""Your mother and Martha,"" Mary checked them off on her fingers, ""and therobin and Ben Weatherstaff.""Dickon laughed so that he was obliged to stifle the sound by putting hisarm over his mouth.""I know tha' thinks I'm a queer lad,"" he said, ""but I think tha' art th'queerest little lass I ever saw.""Then Mary did a strange thing. She leaned forward and asked him aquestion she had never dreamed of asking any one before. And she triedto ask it in Yorkshire because that was his language, and in India anative was always pleased if you knew his speech.""Does tha' like me?"" she said.""Eh!"" he answered heartily, ""that I does. I likes thee wonderful, an' sodoes th' robin, I do believe!""""That's two, then,"" said Mary. ""That's two for me.""And then they began to work harder than ever and more joyfully. Mary wasstartled and sorry when she heard the big clock in the courtyard strikethe hour of her midday dinner.""I shall have to go,"" she said mournfully. ""And you will have to go too,won't you?""Dickon grinned.""My dinner's easy to carry about with me,"" he said. ""Mother always letsme put a bit o' somethin' in my pocket.""He picked up his coat from the grass and brought out of a pocket a lumpylittle bundle tied up in a quiet clean, coarse, blue and whitehandkerchief. It held two thick pieces of bread with a slice ofsomething laid between them.""It's oftenest naught but bread,"" he said, ""but I've got a fine slice o'fat bacon with it to-day.""Mary thought it looked a queer dinner, but he seemed ready to enjoy it.""Run on an' get thy victuals,"" he said. ""I'll be done with mine first.I'll get some more work done before I start back home.""He sat down with his back against a tree.""I'll call th' robin up,"" he said, ""and give him th' rind o' th' baconto peck at. They likes a bit o' fat wonderful.""Mary could scarcely bear to leave him. Suddenly it seemed as if he mightbe a sort of wood fairy who might be gone when she came into the gardenagain. He seemed too good to be true. She went slowly half-way to thedoor in the wall and then she stopped and went back.""Whatever happens, you—you never would tell?"" she said.His poppy-colored cheeks were distended with his first big bite of breadand bacon, but he managed to smile encouragingly.""If tha' was a missel thrush an' showed me where thy nest was, does tha'think I'd tell any one? Not me,"" he said. ""Tha' art as safe as a misselthrush.""And she was quite sure she was."

Her hair was ruffled on her forehead and her cheeks were brightpink. Her dinner was waiting on the table, and Martha was waiting nearit.""Tha's a bit late,"" she said. ""Where has tha' been?""""I've seen Dickon!"" said Mary. ""I've seen Dickon!""""I knew he'd come,"" said Martha exultantly. ""How does tha' like him?""""I think—I think he's beautiful!"" said Mary in a determined voice.Martha looked rather taken aback but she looked pleased, too.""Well,"" she said, ""he's th' best lad as ever was born, but us neverthought he was handsome. His nose turns up too much.""""I like it to turn up,"" said Mary.""An' his eyes is so round,"" said Martha, a trifle doubtful. ""Thoughthey're a nice color.""""I like them round,"" said Mary. ""And they are exactly the color of thesky over the moor.""Martha beamed with satisfaction.""Mother says he made 'em that color with always lookin' up at th' birdsan' th' clouds. But he has got a big mouth, hasn't he, now?""""I love his big mouth,"" said Mary obstinately. ""I wish mine were justlike it.""Martha chuckled delightedly.""It'd look rare an' funny in thy bit of a face,"" she said. ""But I knowedit would be that way when tha' saw him. How did tha' like th' seeds an'th' garden tools?""""How did you know he brought them?"" asked Mary.""Eh! I never thought of him not bringin' 'em. He'd be sure to bring 'emif they was in Yorkshire. He's such a trusty lad.""Mary was afraid that she might begin to ask difficult questions, but shedid not. She was very much interested in the seeds and gardening tools,and there was only one moment when Mary was frightened. This was whenshe began to ask where the flowers were to be planted.""Who did tha' ask about it?"" she inquired.""I haven't asked anybody yet,"" said Mary, hesitating.""Well, I wouldn't ask th' head gardener. He's too grand, Mr. Roach is.""""I've never seen him,"" said Mary. ""I've only seen under-gardeners andBen Weatherstaff.""""If I was you, I'd ask Ben Weatherstaff,"" advised Martha. ""He's not halfas bad as he looks, for all he's so crabbed. Mr. Craven lets him do whathe likes because he was here when Mrs. Craven was alive, an' he used tomake her laugh. She liked him. Perhaps he'd find you a corner somewhereout o' the way.""""If it was out of the way and no one wanted it, no one could mind myhaving it, could they?"" Mary said anxiously.""There wouldn't be no reason,"" answered Martha. ""You wouldn't do noharm.""Mary ate her dinner as quickly as she could and when she rose from thetable she was going to run to her room to put on her hat again, butMartha stopped her.""I've got somethin' to tell you,"" she said. ""I thought I'd let you eatyour dinner first. Mr. Craven came back this mornin' and I think hewants to see you.""Mary turned quite pale.""Oh!"" she said. ""Why! Why! He didn't want to see me when I came. I heardPitcher say he didn't.""""Well,"" explained Martha, ""Mrs. Medlock says it's because o' mother. Shewas walkin' to Thwaite village an' she met him. She'd never spoke to himbefore, but Mrs. Craven had been to our cottage two or three times. He'dforgot, but mother hadn't an' she made bold to stop him. I don't knowwhat she said to him about you but she said somethin' as put him in th'mind to see you before he goes away again, to-morrow.""""Oh!"" cried Mary, ""is he going away to-morrow? I am so glad!""""He's goin' for a long time. He mayn't come back till autumn or winter.He's goin' to travel in foreign places. He's always doin' it.""""Oh! I'm so glad—so glad!"" said Mary thankfully.If he did not come back until winter, or even autumn, there would betime to watch the secret garden come alive. Even if he found out thenand took it away from her she would have had that much at least.""When do you think he will want to see—""She did not finish the sentence, because the door opened, and Mrs.Medlock walked in. She had on her best black dress and cap, and hercollar was fastened with a large brooch with a picture of a man's faceon it. It was a colored photograph of Mr. Medlock who had died yearsago, and she always wore it when she was dressed up. She looked nervousand excited.""Your hair's rough,"" she said quickly. ""Go and brush it. Martha, helpher to slip on her best dress. Mr. Craven sent me to bring her to him inhis study.""All the pink left Mary's cheeks. Her heart began to thump and she feltherself changing into a stiff, plain, silent child again. She did noteven answer Mrs. Medlock, but turned and walked into her bedroom,followed by Martha. She said nothing while her dress was changed, andher hair brushed, and after she was quite tidy she followed Mrs. Medlockdown the corridors, in silence. What was there for her to say? She wasobliged to go and see Mr. Craven and he would not like her, and shewould not like him. She knew what he would think of her.She was taken to a part of the house she had not been into before. Atlast Mrs. Medlock knocked at a door, and when some one said, ""Come in,""they entered the room together. A man was sitting in an armchair beforethe fire, and Mrs. Medlock spoke to him.""This is Miss Mary, sir,"" she said.""You can go and leave her here. I will ring for you when I want you totake her away,"" said Mr. Craven.When she went out and closed the door, Mary could only stand waiting, aplain little thing, twisting her thin hands together. She could see thatthe man in the chair was not so much a hunchback as a man with high,rather crooked shoulders, and he had black hair streaked with white. Heturned his head over his high shoulders and spoke to her.""Come here!"" he said.Mary went to him.He was not ugly. His face would have been handsome if it had not been somiserable. He looked as if the sight of her worried and fretted him andas if he did not know what in the world to do with her.""Are you well?"" he asked.""Yes,"" answered Mary.""Do they take good care of you?""""Yes.""He rubbed his forehead fretfully as he looked her over.""You are very thin,"" he said.""I am getting fatter,"" Mary answered in what she knew was her stiffestway.What an unhappy face he had! His black eyes seemed as if they scarcelysaw her, as if they were seeing something else, and he could hardly keephis thoughts upon her.""I forgot you,"" he said. ""How could I remember you? I intended to sendyou a governess or a nurse, or some one of that sort, but I forgot.""""Please,"" began Mary. ""Please—"" and then the lump in her throat chokedher.""What do you want to say?"" he inquired.""I am—I am too big for a nurse,"" said Mary. ""And please—please don'tmake me have a governess yet.""He rubbed his forehead again and stared at her.""That was what the Sowerby woman said,"" he muttered absent-mindedly.Then Mary gathered a scrap of courage.""Is she—is she Martha's mother?"" she stammered.""Yes, I think so,"" he replied.""She knows about children,"" said Mary. ""She has twelve. She knows.""He seemed to rouse himself.""What do you want to do?""""I want to play out of doors,"" Mary answered, hoping that her voice didnot tremble. ""I never liked it in India. It makes me hungry here, and Iam getting fatter.""He was watching her.""Mrs. Sowerby said it would do you good. Perhaps it will,"" he said. ""Shethought you had better get stronger before you had a governess.""""It makes me feel strong when I play and the wind comes over the moor,""argued Mary.""Where do you play?"" he asked next.""Everywhere,"" gasped Mary. ""Martha's mother sent me a skipping-rope. Iskip and run—and I look about to see if things are beginning to stickup out of the earth. I don't do any harm.""""Don't look so frightened,"" he said in a worried voice. ""You could notdo any harm, a child like you! You may do what you like.""Mary put her hand up to her throat because she was afraid he might seethe excited lump which she felt jump into it. She came a step nearer tohim.""May I?"" she said tremulously.Her anxious little face seemed to worry him more than ever.""Don't look so frightened,"" he exclaimed. ""Of course you may. I am yourguardian, though I am a poor one for any child. I cannot give you timeor attention. I am too ill, and wretched and distracted; but I wish youto be happy and comfortable. I don't know anything about children, butMrs. Medlock is to see that you have all you need. I sent for you to-daybecause Mrs. Sowerby said I ought to see you. Her daughter had talkedabout you. She thought you needed fresh air and freedom and runningabout.""""She knows all about children,"" Mary said again in spite of herself.""She ought to,"" said Mr. Craven. ""I thought her rather bold to stop meon the moor, but she said—Mrs. Craven had been kind to her."" It seemedhard for him to speak his dead wife's name. ""She is a respectable woman.Now I have seen you I think she said sensible things. Play out of doorsas much as you like. It's a big place and you may go where you like andamuse yourself as you like. Is there anything you want?"" as if a suddenthought had struck him. ""Do you want toys, books, dolls?""""Might I,"" quavered Mary, ""might I have a bit of earth?""In her eagerness she did not realize how queer the words would sound andthat they were not the ones she had meant to say. Mr. Craven lookedquite startled.""Earth!"" he repeated. ""What do you mean?""""To plant seeds in—to make things grow—to see them come alive,"" Maryfaltered.He gazed at her a moment and then passed his hand quickly over hiseyes.""Do you—care about gardens so much,"" he said slowly.""I didn't know about them in India,"" said Mary. ""I was always ill andtired and it was too hot. I sometimes made little beds in the sand andstuck flowers in them. But here it is different.""Mr. Craven got up and began to walk slowly across the room.""A bit of earth,"" he said to himself, and Mary thought that somehow shemust have reminded him of something. When he stopped and spoke to herhis dark eyes looked almost soft and kind.""You can have as much earth as you want,"" he said. ""You remind me ofsome one else who loved the earth and things that grow. When you see abit of earth you want,"" with something like a smile, ""take it, child,and make it come alive.""""May I take it from anywhere—if it's not wanted?""""Anywhere,"" he answered. ""There! You must go now, I am tired."" Hetouched the bell to call Mrs. Medlock. ""Good-by. I shall be away allsummer.""Mrs. Medlock came so quickly that Mary thought she must have beenwaiting in the corridor.""Mrs. Medlock,"" Mr. Craven said to her, ""now I have seen the child Iunderstand what Mrs. Sowerby meant. She must be less delicate before shebegins lessons. Give her simple, healthy food. Let her run wild in thegarden. Don't look after her too much. She needs liberty and fresh airand romping about. Mrs. Sowerby is to come and see her now and then andshe may sometimes go to the cottage.""Mrs. Medlock looked pleased. She was relieved to hear that she need not""look after"" Mary too much. She had felt her a tiresome charge and hadindeed seen as little of her as she dared. In addition to this she wasfond of Martha's mother.""Thank you, sir,"" she said. ""Susan Sowerby and me went to schooltogether and she's as sensible and good-hearted a woman as you'd find ina day's walk. I never had any children myself and she's had twelve, andthere never was healthier or better ones. Miss Mary can get no harm fromthem. I'd always take Susan Sowerby's advice about children myself.She's what you might call healthy-minded—if you understand me.""""I understand,"" Mr. Craven answered. ""Take Miss Mary away now and sendPitcher to me.""When Mrs. Medlock left her at the end of her own corridor Mary flew backto her room. She found Martha waiting there. Martha had, in fact,hurried back after she had removed the dinner service.""I can have my garden!"" cried Mary. ""I may have it where I like! I amnot going to have a governess for a long time! Your mother is coming tosee me and I may go to your cottage! He says a little girl like me couldnot do any harm and I may do what I like—anywhere!""""Eh!"" said Martha delightedly, ""that was nice of him wasn't it?""""Martha,"" said Mary solemnly, ""he is really a nice man, only his face isso miserable and his forehead is all drawn together.""She ran as quickly as she could to the garden. She had been away so muchlonger than she had thought she should and she knew Dickon would have toset out early on his five-mile walk. When she slipped through the doorunder the ivy, she saw he was not working where she had left him. Thegardening tools were laid together under a tree. She ran to them,looking all round the place, but there was no Dickon to be seen. He hadgone away and the secret garden was empty—except for the robin who hadjust flown across the wall and sat on a standard rose-bush watchingher.""He's gone,"" she said wofully. ""Oh! was he—was he—was he only a woodfairy?""Something white fastened to the standard rose-bush caught her eye. Itwas a piece of paper—in fact, it was a piece of the letter she hadprinted for Martha to send to Dickon. It was fastened on the bush with along thorn, and in a minute she knew Dickon had left it there. Therewere some roughly printed letters on it and a sort of picture. At firstshe could not tell what it was. Then she saw it was meant for a nestwith a bird sitting on it. Underneath were the printed letters and theysaid:""I will cum bak."""

""I never knew our Dickon was asclever as that. That there's a picture of a missel thrush on her nest,as large as life an' twice as natural.""Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He hadmeant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden washer nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like thatqueer, common boy!She hoped he would come back the very next day and she fell asleeplooking forward to the morning.But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularlyin the springtime. She was awakened in the night by the sound of rainbeating with heavy drops against her window. It was pouring down intorrents and the wind was ""wuthering"" round the corners and in thechimneys of the huge old house. Mary sat up in bed and felt miserableand angry.""The rain is as contrary as I ever was,"" she said. ""It came because itknew I did not want it.""She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did notcry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, shehated the wind and its ""wuthering."" She could not go to sleep again. Themournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself. If shehad felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it""wuthered"" and how the big rain-drops poured down and beat against thepane!""It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and oncrying,"" she said.She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour,when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head towardthe door listening. She listened and she listened.""It isn't the wind now,"" she said in a loud whisper. ""That isn't thewind. It is different. It is that crying I heard before.""The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, afar-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutesand each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she mustfind out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden andthe buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood madeher bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.""I am going to find out what it is,"" she said. ""Everybody is in bed andI don't care about Mrs. Medlock—I don't care!""There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly outof the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was tooexcited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she mustturn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry—theone Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself. The soundhad come up that passage. So she went on with her dim light, almostfeeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she couldhear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led her. Sometimes itstopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this the rightcorner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this passageand then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the rightagain. Yes, there was the tapestry door.She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stoodin the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it wasnot loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a fewyards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of lightcoming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it wasquite a young Someone.So she walked to the door and pushed it open, and there she was standingin the room!It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was alow fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by theside of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed waslying a boy, crying fretfully.Mary wondered if she was in a real place or if she had fallen asleepagain and was dreaming without knowing it.The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed tohave eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled overhis forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. Helooked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he weretired and cross than as if he were in pain.Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding herbreath. Then she crept across the room, and as she drew nearer thelight attracted the boy's attention and he turned his head on his pillowand stared at her, his gray eyes opening so wide that they seemedimmense.""Who are you?"" he said at last in a half-frightened whisper. ""Are you aghost?""""No, I am not,"" Mary answered, her own whisper sounding half frightened.""Are you one?""He stared and stared and stared. Mary could not help noticing whatstrange eyes he had. They were agate gray and they looked too big forhis face because they had black lashes all round them.""No,"" he replied after waiting a moment or so. ""I am Colin.""""Who is Colin?"" she faltered.""I am Colin Craven. Who are you?""""I am Mary Lennox. Mr. Craven is my uncle.""""He is my father,"" said the boy.""Your father!"" gasped Mary. ""No one ever told me he had a boy! Whydidn't they?""""Come here,"" he said, still keeping his strange eyes fixed on her withan anxious expression.She came close to the bed and he put out his hand and touched her.""You are real, aren't you?"" he said. ""I have such real dreams veryoften. You might be one of them.""Mary had slipped on a woolen wrapper before she left her room and sheput a piece of it between his fingers.""Rub that and see how thick and warm it is,"" she said. ""I will pinch youa little if you like, to show you how real I am. For a minute I thoughtyou might be a dream too.""""Where did you come from?"" he asked.""From my own room. The wind wuthered so I couldn't go to sleep and Iheard some one crying and wanted to find out who it was. What were youcrying for?""""Because I couldn't go to sleep either and my head ached. Tell me yourname again.""""Mary Lennox. Did no one ever tell you I had come to live here?""He was still fingering the fold of her wrapper, but he began to look alittle more as if he believed in her reality.""No,"" he answered. ""They daren't.""""Why?"" asked Mary.""Because I should have been afraid you would see me. I won't let peoplesee me and talk me over.""""Why?"" Mary asked again, feeling more mystified every moment.""Because I am like this always, ill and having to lie down. My fatherwon't let people talk me over either. The servants are not allowed tospeak about me. If I live I may be a hunchback, but I shan't live. Myfather hates to think I may be like him.""""Oh, what a queer house this is!"" Mary said. ""What a queer house!Everything is a kind of secret. Rooms are locked up and gardens arelocked up—and you! Have you been locked up?""""No. I stay in this room because I don't want to be moved out of it. Ittires me too much.""""Does your father come and see you?"" Mary ventured.""Sometimes. Generally when I am asleep. He doesn't want to see me.""""Why?"" Mary could not help asking again.A sort of angry shadow passed over the boy's face.""My mother died when I was born and it makes him wretched to look at me.He thinks I don't know, but I've heard people talking. He almost hatesme.""""He hates the garden, because she died,"" said Mary half speaking toherself.""What garden?"" the boy asked.""Oh! just—just a garden she used to like,"" Mary stammered. ""Have youbeen here always?""""Nearly always. Sometimes I have been taken to places at the seaside,but I won't stay because people stare at me. I used to wear an ironthing to keep my back straight, but a grand doctor came from London tosee me and said it was stupid. He told them to take it off and keep meout in the fresh air. I hate fresh air and I don't want to go out.""""I didn't when first I came here,"" said Mary. ""Why do you keep lookingat me like that?""""Because of the dreams that are so real,"" he answered rather fretfully.""Sometimes when I open my eyes I don't believe I'm awake.""""We're both awake,"" said Mary. She glanced round the room with its highceiling and shadowy corners and dim firelight. ""It looks quite like adream, and it's the middle of the night, and everybody in the house isasleep—everybody but us. We are wide awake.""""I don't want it to be a dream,"" the boy said restlessly.Mary thought of something all at once.""If you don't like people to see you,"" she began, ""do you want me to goaway?""He still held the fold of her wrapper and he gave it a little pull.""No,"" he said. ""I should be sure you were a dream if you went. If youare real, sit down on that big footstool and talk. I want to hear aboutyou.""Mary put down her candle on the table near the bed and sat down on thecushioned stool. She did not want to go away at all. She wanted to stayin the mysterious hidden-away room and talk to the mysterious boy.""What do you want me to tell you?"" she said.He wanted to know how long she had been at Misselthwaite; he wanted toknow which corridor her room was on; he wanted to know what she had beendoing; if she disliked the moor as he disliked it; where she had livedbefore she came to Yorkshire. She answered all these questions and manymore and he lay back on his pillow and listened. He made her tell him agreat deal about India and about her voyage across the ocean. She foundout that because he had been an invalid he had not learned things asother children had. One of his nurses had taught him to read when he wasquite little and he was always reading and looking at pictures insplendid books.Though his father rarely saw him when he was awake, he was given allsorts of wonderful things to amuse himself with. He never seemed to havebeen amused, however. He could have anything he asked for and was nevermade to do anything he did not like to do.""Every one is obliged to do what pleases me,"" he said indifferently. ""Itmakes me ill to be angry. No one believes I shall live to grow up.""He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased tomatter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary's voice. Asshe went on talking he listened in a drowsy, interested way. Once ortwice she wondered if he were not gradually falling into a doze. But atlast he asked a question which opened up a new subject.""How old are you?"" he asked.""I am ten,"" answered Mary, forgetting herself for the moment, ""and soare you.""""How do you know that?"" he demanded in a surprised voice.""Because when you were born the garden door was locked and the key wasburied. And it has been locked for ten years.""Colin half sat up, turning toward her, leaning on his elbows.""What garden door was locked? Who did it? Where was the key buried?"" heexclaimed as if he were suddenly very much interested.""It—it was the garden Mr. Craven hates,"" said Mary nervously. ""Helocked the door. No one—no one knew where he buried the key.""""What sort of a garden is it?"" Colin persisted eagerly.""No one has been allowed to go into it for ten years,"" was Mary'scareful answer.But it was too late to be careful. He was too much like herself. He toohad had nothing to think about and the idea of a hidden garden attractedhim as it had attracted her. He asked question after question. Where wasit? Had she never looked for the door? Had she never asked thegardeners?""They won't talk about it,"" said Mary. ""I think they have been told notto answer questions.""""I would make them,"" said Colin.""Could you?"" Mary faltered, beginning to feel frightened. If he couldmake people answer questions, who knew what might happen!""Every one is obliged to please me. I told you that,"" he said. ""If Iwere to live, this place would sometime belong to me. They all knowthat. I would make them tell me.""Mary had not known that she herself had been spoiled, but she could seequite plainly that this mysterious boy had been. He thought that thewhole world belonged to him. How peculiar he was and how coolly he spokeof not living.""Do you think you won't live?"" she asked, partly because she wascurious and partly in hope of making him forget the garden.""I don't suppose I shall,"" he answered as indifferently as he had spokenbefore. ""Ever since I remember anything I have heard people say Ishan't. At first they thought I was too little to understand and nowthey think I don't hear. But I do. My doctor is my father's cousin. Heis quite poor and if I die he will have all Misselthwaite when my fatheris dead. I should think he wouldn't want me to live.""""Do you want to live?"" inquired Mary.""No,"" he answered, in a cross, tired fashion. ""But I don't want to die.When I feel ill I lie here and think about it until I cry and cry.""""I have heard you crying three times,"" Mary said, ""but I did not knowwho it was. Were you crying about that?"" She did so want him to forgetthe garden.""I dare say,"" he answered. ""Let us talk about something else. Talk aboutthat garden. Don't you want to see it?""""Yes,"" answered Mary, in quite a low voice.""I do,"" he went on persistently. ""I don't think I ever really wanted tosee anything before, but I want to see that garden. I want the key dugup. I want the door unlocked. I would let them take me there in mychair. That would be getting fresh air. I am going to make them openthe door.""He had become quite excited and his strange eyes began to shine likestars and looked more immense than ever.""They have to please me,"" he said. ""I will make them take me there and Iwill let you go, too.""Mary's hands clutched each other. Everything would bespoiled—everything! Dickon would never come back. She would never againfeel like a missel thrush with a safe-hidden nest.""Oh, don't—don't—don't—don't do that!"" she cried out.He stared as if he thought she had gone crazy!""Why?"" he exclaimed. ""You said you wanted to see it.""""I do,"" she answered almost with a sob in her throat, ""but if you makethem open the door and take you in like that it will never be a secretagain.""He leaned still farther forward.""A secret,"" he said. ""What do you mean? Tell me.""Mary's words almost tumbled over one another.""You see—you see,"" she panted, ""if no one knows but ourselves—if therewas a door, hidden somewhere under the ivy—if there was—and we couldfind it; and if we could slip through it together and shut it behindus, and no one knew any one was inside and we called it our garden andpretended that—that we were missel thrushes and it was our nest, and ifwe played there almost every day and dug and planted seeds and made itall come alive—""""Is it dead?"" he interrupted her.""It soon will be if no one cares for it,"" she went on. ""The bulbs willlive but the roses—""He stopped her again as excited as she was herself.""What are bulbs?"" he put in quickly.""They are daffodils and lilies and snowdrops. They are working in theearth now—pushing up pale green points because the spring is coming.""""Is the spring coming?"" he said. ""What is it like? You don't see it inrooms if you are ill.""""It is the sun shining on the rain and the rain falling on the sunshine,and things pushing up and working under the earth,"" said Mary. ""If thegarden was a secret and we could get into it we could watch the thingsgrow bigger every day, and see how many roses are alive. Don't you see?Oh, don't you see how much nicer it would be if it was a secret?""He dropped back on his pillow and lay there with an odd expression onhis face.""I never had a secret,"" he said, ""except that one about not living togrow up. They don't know I know that, so it is a sort of secret. But Ilike this kind better.""""If you won't make them take you to the garden,"" pleaded Mary,""perhaps—I feel almost sure I can find out how to get in sometime. Andthen—if the doctor wants you to go out in your chair, and if you canalways do what you want to do, perhaps—perhaps we might find some boywho would push you, and we could go alone and it would always be asecret garden.""""I should—like—that,"" he said very slowly, his eyes looking dreamy. ""Ishould like that. I should not mind fresh air in a secret garden.""Mary began to recover her breath and feel safer because the idea ofkeeping the secret seemed to please him. She felt almost sure that ifshe kept on talking and could make him see the garden in his mind as shehad seen it he would like it so much that he could not bear to thinkthat everybody might tramp into it when they chose.""I'll tell you what I think it would be like, if we could go into it,""she said. ""It has been shut up so long things have grown into a tangleperhaps.""He lay quite still and listened while she went on talking about theroses which might have clambered from tree to tree and hungdown—about the many birds which might have built their nests therebecause it was so safe. And then she told him about the robin and BenWeatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it wasso easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to feel afraid. Therobin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almostbeautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer thanherself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.""I did not know birds could be like that,"" he said. ""But if you stay ina room you never see things. What a lot of things you know. I feel as ifyou had been inside that garden.""She did not know what to say, so she did not say anything. He evidentlydid not expect an answer and the next moment he gave her a surprise.""I am going to let you look at something,"" he said. ""Do you see thatrose-colored silk curtain hanging on the wall over the mantel-piece?""Mary had not noticed it before, but she looked up and saw it. It was acurtain of soft silk hanging over what seemed to be some picture.""Yes,"" she answered.""There is a cord hanging from it,"" said Colin. ""Go and pull it.""Mary got up, much mystified, and found the cord. When she pulled it thesilk curtain ran back on rings and when it ran back it uncovered apicture. It was the picture of a girl with a laughing face. She hadbright hair tied up with a blue ribbon and her gay, lovely eyes wereexactly like Colin's unhappy ones, agate gray and looking twice as bigas they really were because of the black lashes all round them.""She is my mother,"" said Colin complainingly. ""I don't see why she died.Sometimes I hate her for doing it.""""How queer!"" said Mary.""If she had lived I believe I should not have been ill always,"" hegrumbled. ""I dare say I should have lived, too. And my father would nothave hated to look at me. I dare say I should have had a strong back.Draw the curtain again.""Mary did as she was told and returned to her footstool.""She is much prettier than you,"" she said, ""but her eyes are just likeyours—at least they are the same shape and color. Why is the curtaindrawn over her?""He moved uncomfortably.""I made them do it,"" he said. ""Sometimes I don't like to see her lookingat me. She smiles too much when I am ill and miserable. Besides, she ismine and I don't want every one to see her.""There were a few moments of silence and then Mary spoke.""What would Mrs. Medlock do if she found out that I had been here?"" sheinquired.""She would do as I told her to do,"" he answered. ""And I should tell herthat I wanted you to come here and talk to me every day. I am glad youcame.""""So am I,"" said Mary. ""I will come as often as I can, but""—shehesitated—""I shall have to look every day for the garden door.""""Yes, you must,"" said Colin, ""and you can tell me about it afterward.""He lay thinking a few minutes, as he had done before, and then he spokeagain.""I think you shall be a secret, too,"" he said. ""I will not tell themuntil they find out. I can always send the nurse out of the room and saythat I want to be by myself. Do you know Martha?""""Yes, I know her very well,"" said Mary. ""She waits on me.""He nodded his head toward the outer corridor.""She is the one who is asleep in the other room. The nurse went awayyesterday to stay all night with her sister and she always makes Marthaattend to me when she wants to go out. Martha shall tell you when tocome here.""Then Mary understood Martha's troubled look when she had askedquestions about the crying.""Martha knew about you all the time?"" she said.""Yes; she often attends to me. The nurse likes to get away from me andthen Martha comes.""""I have been here a long time,"" said Mary. ""Shall I go away now? Youreyes look sleepy.""""I wish I could go to sleep before you leave me,"" he said rather shyly.""Shut your eyes,"" said Mary, drawing her footstool closer, ""and I willdo what my Ayah used to do in India. I will pat your hand and stroke itand sing something quite low.""""I should like that perhaps,"" he said drowsily.Somehow she was sorry for him and did not want him to lie awake, so sheleaned against the bed and began to stroke and pat his hand and sing avery low little chanting song in Hindustani.""That is nice,"" he said more drowsily still, and she went on chantingand stroking, but when she looked at him again his black lashes werelying close against his cheeks, for his eyes were shut and he was fastasleep. So she got up softly, took her candle and crept away withoutmaking a sound."

There could be no going out of doors. Martha wasso busy that Mary had no opportunity of talking to her, but in theafternoon she asked her to come and sit with her in the nursery. Shecame bringing the stocking she was always knitting when she was doingnothing else.""What's the matter with thee?"" she asked as soon as they sat down. ""Tha'looks as if tha'd somethin' to say.""""I have. I have found out what the crying was,"" said Mary.Martha let her knitting drop on her knee and gazed at her with startledeyes.""Tha' hasn't!"" she exclaimed. ""Never!""""I heard it in the night,"" Mary went on. ""And I got up and went to seewhere it came from. It was Colin. I found him.""Martha's face became red with fright.""Eh! Miss Mary!"" she said half crying. ""Tha' shouldn't have doneit—tha' shouldn't! Tha'll get me in trouble. I never told thee nothin'about him—but tha'll get me in trouble. I shall lose my place andwhat'll mother do!""""You won't lose your place,"" said Mary. ""He was glad I came. We talkedand talked and he said he was glad I came.""""Was he?"" cried Martha. ""Art tha' sure? Tha' doesn't know what he's likewhen anything vexes him. He's a big lad to cry like a baby, but whenhe's in a passion he'll fair scream just to frighten us. He knows usdaren't call our souls our own.""""He wasn't vexed,"" said Mary. ""I asked him if I should go away and hemade me stay. He asked me questions and I sat on a big footstool andtalked to him about India and about the robin and gardens. He wouldn'tlet me go. He let me see his mother's picture. Before I left him I sanghim to sleep.""Martha fairly gasped with amazement.""I can scarcely believe thee!"" she protested. ""It's as if tha'd walkedstraight into a lion's den. If he'd been like he is most times he'd havethrowed himself into one of his tantrums and roused th' house. He won'tlet strangers look at him.""""He let me look at him. I looked at him all the time and he looked atme. We stared!"" said Mary.""I don't know what to do!"" cried agitated Martha. ""If Mrs. Medlock findsout, she'll think I broke orders and told thee and I shall be packedback to mother.""""He is not going to tell Mrs. Medlock anything about it yet. It's to bea sort of secret just at first,"" said Mary firmly. ""And he sayseverybody is obliged to do as he pleases.""""Aye, that's true enough—th' bad lad!"" sighed Martha, wiping herforehead with her apron.""He says Mrs. Medlock must. And he wants me to come and talk to himevery day. And you are to tell me when he wants me.""""Me!"" said Martha; "" I shall lose my place—I shall for sure!""""You can't if you are doing what he wants you to do and everybody isordered to obey him,"" Mary argued.""Does tha' mean to say,"" cried Martha with wide open eyes, ""that he wasnice to thee!""""I think he almost liked me,"" Mary answered.""Then tha' must have bewitched him!"" decided Martha, drawing a longbreath.""Do you mean Magic?"" inquired Mary. ""I've heard about Magic in India,but I can't make it. I just went into his room and I was so surprisedto see him I stood and stared. And then he turned round and stared atme. And he thought I was a ghost or a dream and I thought perhaps hewas. And it was so queer being there alone together in the middle of thenight and not knowing about each other. And we began to ask each otherquestions. And when I asked him if I must go away he said I must not.""""Th' world's comin' to a end!"" gasped Martha.""What is the matter with him?"" asked Mary.""Nobody knows for sure and certain,"" said Martha. ""Mr. Craven went offhis head like when he was born. Th' doctors thought he'd have to be putin a 'sylum. It was because Mrs. Craven died like I told you. Hewouldn't set eyes on th' baby. He just raved and said it'd be anotherhunchback like him and it'd better die.""""Is Colin a hunchback?"" Mary asked. ""He didn't look like one.""""He isn't yet,"" said Martha. ""But he began all wrong. Mother said thatthere was enough trouble and raging in th' house to set any child wrong.They was afraid his back was weak an' they've always been takin' care ofit—keepin' him lyin' down and not lettin' him walk. Once they made himwear a brace but he fretted so he was downright ill. Then a big doctorcame to see him an' made them take it off. He talked to th' other doctorquite rough—in a polite way. He said there'd been too much medicine andtoo much lettin' him have his own way.""""I think he's a very spoiled boy,"" said Mary.""He's th' worst young nowt as ever was!"" said Martha. ""I won't say as hehasn't been ill a good bit. He's had coughs an' colds that's nearlykilled him two or three times. Once he had rheumatic fever an' once hehad typhoid. Eh! Mrs. Medlock did get a fright then. He'd been out ofhis head an' she was talkin' to th' nurse, thinkin' he didn't knownothin', an' she said, 'He'll die this time sure enough, an' best thingfor him an' for everybody.' An' she looked at him an' there he was withhis big eyes open, starin' at her as sensible as she was herself. Shedidn't know what'd happen but he just stared at her an' says, 'You giveme some water an' stop talkin'.'""""Do you think he will die?"" asked Mary.""Mother says there's no reason why any child should live that gets nofresh air an' doesn't do nothin' but lie on his back an' readpicture-books an' take medicine. He's weak and hates th' trouble o'bein' taken out o' doors, an' he gets cold so easy he says it makes himill.""Mary sat and looked at the fire.""I wonder,"" she said slowly, ""if it would not do him good to go out intoa garden and watch things growing. It did me good.""""One of th' worst fits he ever had,"" said Martha, ""was one time theytook him out where the roses is by the fountain. He'd been readin' in apaper about people gettin' somethin' he called 'rose cold' an' he beganto sneeze an' said he'd got it an' then a new gardener as didn't knowth' rules passed by an' looked at him curious. He threw himself into apassion an' he said he'd looked at him because he was going to be ahunchback. He cried himself into a fever an' was ill all night.""""If he ever gets angry at me, I'll never go and see him again,"" saidMary.""He'll have thee if he wants thee,"" said Martha. ""Tha' may as well knowthat at th' start.""Very soon afterward a bell rang and she rolled up her knitting.""I dare say th' nurse wants me to stay with him a bit,"" she said. ""Ihope he's in a good temper.""She was out of the room about ten minutes and then she came back with apuzzled expression.""Well, tha' has bewitched him,"" she said. ""He's up on his sofa with hispicture-books. He's told the nurse to stay away until six o'clock. I'mto wait in the next room. Th' minute she was gone he called me to himan' says, 'I want Mary Lennox to come and talk to me, and rememberyou're not to tell any one.' You'd better go as quick as you can.""Mary was quite willing to go quickly. She did not want to see Colin asmuch as she wanted to see Dickon, but she wanted to see him very much.There was a bright fire on the hearth when she entered his room, and inthe daylight she saw it was a very beautiful room indeed. There wererich colors in the rugs and hangings and pictures and books on the wallswhich made it look glowing and comfortable even in spite of the gray skyand falling rain. Colin looked rather like a picture himself. He waswrapped in a velvet dressing-gown and sat against a big brocadedcushion. He had a red spot on each cheek.""Come in,"" he said. ""I've been thinking about you all morning.""""I've been thinking about you, too,"" answered Mary. ""You don't know howfrightened Martha is. She says Mrs. Medlock will think she told me aboutyou and then she will be sent away.""He frowned.""Go and tell her to come here,"" he said. ""She is in the next room.""Mary went and brought her back. Poor Martha was shaking in her shoes.Colin was still frowning.""Have you to do what I please or have you not?"" he demanded.""I have to do what you please, sir,"" Martha faltered, turning quite red.""Has Medlock to do what I please?""""Everybody has, sir,"" said Martha.""Well, then, if I order you to bring Miss Mary to me, how can Medlocksend you away if she finds it out?""""Please don't let her, sir,"" pleaded Martha.""I'll send her away if she dares to say a word about such a thing,""said Master Craven grandly. ""She wouldn't like that, I can tell you.""""Thank you, sir,"" bobbing a curtsy, ""I want to do my duty, sir.""""What I want is your duty,"" said Colin more grandly still. ""I'll takecare of you. Now go away.""When the door closed behind Martha, Colin found Mistress Mary gazing athim as if he had set her wondering.""Why do you look at me like that?"" he asked her. ""What are you thinkingabout?""""I am thinking about two things.""""What are they? Sit down and tell me.""""This is the first one,"" said Mary, seating herself on the big stool.""Once in India I saw a boy who was a Rajah. He had rubies and emeraldsand diamonds stuck all over him. He spoke to his people just as youspoke to Martha. Everybody had to do everything he told them—in aminute. I think they would have been killed if they hadn't.""""I shall make you tell me about Rajahs presently,"" he said, ""but firsttell me what the second thing was.""""I was thinking,"" said Mary, ""how different you are from Dickon.""""Who is Dickon?"" he said. ""What a queer name!""She might as well tell him, she thought. She could talk about Dickonwithout mentioning the secret garden. She had liked to hear Martha talkabout him. Besides, she longed to talk about him. It would seem to bringhim nearer.""He is Martha's brother. He is twelve years old,"" she explained. ""He isnot like any one else in the world. He can charm foxes and squirrels andbirds just as the natives in India charm snakes. He plays a very softtune on a pipe and they come and listen.""There were some big books on a table at his side and he dragged onesuddenly toward him.""There is a picture of a snake-charmer in this,"" he exclaimed. ""Come andlook at it.""The book was a beautiful one with superb colored illustrations and heturned to one of them.""Can he do that?"" he asked eagerly.""He played on his pipe and they listened,"" Mary explained. ""But hedoesn't call it Magic. He says it's because he lives on the moor so muchand he knows their ways. He says he feels sometimes as if he was a birdor a rabbit himself, he likes them so. I think he asked the robinquestions. It seemed as if they talked to each other in soft chirps.""Colin lay back on his cushion and his eyes grew larger and larger andthe spots on his cheeks burned.""Tell me some more about him,"" he said.""He knows all about eggs and nests,"" Mary went on. "" And he knows wherefoxes and badgers and otters live. He keeps them secret so that otherboys won't find their holes and frighten them. He knows about everythingthat grows or lives on the moor.""""Does he like the moor?"" said Colin. ""How can he when it's such a great,bare, dreary place?""""It's the most beautiful place,"" protested Mary. ""Thousands of lovelythings grow on it and there are thousands of little creatures all busybuilding nests and making holes and burrows and chippering or singingor squeaking to each other. They are so busy and having such fun underthe earth or in the trees or heather. It's their world.""""How do you know all that?"" said Colin, turning on his elbow to look ather.""I have never been there once, really,"" said Mary suddenly remembering.""I only drove over it in the dark. I thought it was hideous. Martha toldme about it first and then Dickon. When Dickon talks about it you feelas if you saw things and heard them and as if you were standing in theheather with the sun shining and the gorse smelling like honey—and allfull of bees and butterflies.""""You never see anything if you are ill,"" said Colin restlessly. Helooked like a person listening to a new sound in the distance andwondering what it was.""You can't if you stay in a room,"" said Mary.""I couldn't go on the moor,"" he said in a resentful tone.Mary was silent for a minute and then she said something bold.""You might—sometime.""He moved as if he were startled.""Go on the moor! How could I? I am going to die.""""How do you know?"" said Mary unsympathetically. She didn't like the wayhe had of talking about dying. She did not feel very sympathetic. Shefelt rather as if he almost boasted about it.""Oh, I've heard it ever since I remember,"" he answered crossly. ""Theyare always whispering about it and thinking I don't notice. They wish Iwould, too.""Mistress Mary felt quite contrary. She pinched her lips together.""If they wished I would,"" she said, ""I wouldn't. Who wishes you would?""""The servants—and of course Dr. Craven because he would getMisselthwaite and be rich instead of poor. He daren't say so, but healways looks cheerful when I am worse. When I had typhoid fever his facegot quite fat. I think my father wishes it, too.""""I don't believe he does,"" said Mary quite obstinately.That made Colin turn and look at her again.""Don't you?"" he said.And then he lay back on his cushion and was still, as if he werethinking. And there was quite a long silence. Perhaps they were both ofthem thinking strange things children do not usually think of.""I like the grand doctor from London, because he made them take the ironthing off,"" said Mary at last. ""Did he say you were going to die?""""No.""""What did he say?""""He didn't whisper,"" Colin answered. ""Perhaps he knew I hatedwhispering. I heard him say one thing quite aloud. He said, 'The ladmight live if he would make up his mind to it. Put him in the humor.' Itsounded as if he was in a temper.""""I'll tell you who would put you in the humor, perhaps,"" said Maryreflecting. She felt as if she would like this thing to be settled oneway or the other. ""I believe Dickon would. He's always talking aboutlive things. He never talks about dead things or things that are ill.He's always looking up in the sky to watch birds flying—or looking downat the earth to see something growing. He has such round blue eyes andthey are so wide open with looking about. And he laughs such a big laughwith his wide mouth—and his cheeks are as red—as red as cherries.""She pulled her stool nearer to the sofa and her expression quite changedat the remembrance of the wide curving mouth and wide open eyes.""See here,"" she said. ""Don't let us talk about dying; I don't like it.Let us talk about living. Let us talk and talk about Dickon. And then wewill look at your pictures.""It was the best thing she could have said. To talk about Dickon meant totalk about the moor and about the cottage and the fourteen people wholived in it on sixteen shillings a week—and the children who got fat onthe moor grass like the wild ponies. And about Dickon's mother—and theskipping-rope—and the moor with the sun on it—and about pale greenpoints sticking up out of the black sod. And it was all so alive thatMary talked more than she had ever talked before—and Colin both talkedand listened as he had never done either before. And they both began tolaugh over nothings as children will when they are happy together. Andthey laughed so that in the end they were making as much noise as ifthey had been two ordinary healthy natural ten-year-oldcreatures—instead of a hard, little, unloving girl and a sickly boy whobelieved that he was going to die.They enjoyed themselves so much that they forgot the pictures and theyforgot about the time. They had been laughing quite loudly over BenWeatherstaff and his robin and Colin was actually sitting up as if hehad forgotten about his weak back when he suddenly rememberedsomething.""Do you know there is one thing we have never once thought of,"" he said.""We are cousins.""It seemed so queer that they had talked so much and never rememberedthis simple thing that they laughed more than ever, because they had gotinto the humor to laugh at anything. And in the midst of the fun thedoor opened and in walked Dr. Craven and Mrs. Medlock.Dr. Craven started in actual alarm and Mrs. Medlock almost fell backbecause he had accidentally bumped against her.""Good Lord!"" exclaimed poor Mrs. Medlock, with her eyes almost startingout of her head. ""Good Lord!""""What is this?"" said Dr. Craven, coming forward. ""What does it mean?""Then Mary was reminded of the boy Rajah again. Colin answered as ifneither the doctor's alarm nor Mrs. Medlock's terror were of theslightest consequence. He was as little disturbed or frightened as if anelderly cat and dog had walked into the room.""This is my cousin, Mary Lennox,"" he said. ""I asked her to come and talkto me. I like her. She must come and talk to me whenever I send forher.""Dr. Craven turned reproachfully to Mrs. Medlock.""Oh, sir,"" she panted. ""I don't know how it's happened. There's not aservant on the place that'd dare to talk—they all have their orders.""""Nobody told her anything,"" said Colin, ""she heard me crying and foundme herself. I am glad she came. Don't be silly, Medlock.""Mary saw that Dr. Craven did not look pleased, but it was quite plainthat he dare not oppose his patient. He sat down by Colin and felt hispulse.""I am afraid there has been too much excitement. Excitement is not goodfor you, my boy,"" he said.""I should be excited if she kept away,"" answered Colin, his eyesbeginning to look dangerously sparkling. ""I am better. She makes mebetter. The nurse must bring up her tea with mine. We will have teatogether.""Mrs. Medlock and Dr. Craven looked at each other in a troubled way, butthere was evidently nothing to be done.""He does look rather better, sir,"" ventured Mrs. Medlock.""But""—thinking the matter over—""he looked better this morning beforeshe came into the room.""""She came into the room last night. She stayed with me a long time. Shesang a Hindustani song to me and it made me go to sleep,"" said Colin. ""Iwas better when I wakened up. I wanted my breakfast. I want my tea now.Tell nurse, Medlock.""Dr. Craven did not stay very long. He talked to the nurse for a fewminutes when she came into the room and said a few words of warning toColin. He must not talk too much; he must not forget that he was ill; hemust not forget that he was very easily tired. Mary thought that thereseemed to be a number of uncomfortable things he was not to forget.Colin looked fretful and kept his strange black-lashed eyes fixed on Dr.Craven's face.""I want to forget it,"" he said at last. ""She makes me forget it. Thatis why I want her.""Dr. Craven did not look happy when he left the room. He gave a puzzledglance at the little girl sitting on the large stool. She had become astiff, silent child again as soon as he entered and he could not seewhat the attraction was. The boy actually did look brighter,however—and he sighed rather heavily as he went down the corridor.""They are always wanting me to eat things when I don't want to,"" saidColin, as the nurse brought in the tea and put it on the table by thesofa. ""Now, if you'll eat I will. Those muffins look so nice and hot.Tell me about Rajahs."""

Though there had been no chanceto see either the secret garden or Dickon, Mistress Mary had enjoyedherself very much. The week had not seemed long. She had spent hours ofevery day with Colin in his room, talking about Rajahs or gardens orDickon and the cottage on the moor. They had looked at the splendidbooks and pictures and sometimes Mary had read things to Colin, andsometimes he had read a little to her. When he was amused and interestedshe thought he scarcely looked like an invalid at all, except that hisface was so colorless and he was always on the sofa.""You are a sly young one to listen and get out of your bed to gofollowing things up like you did that night,"" Mrs. Medlock said once.""But there's no saying it's not been a sort of blessing to the lot ofus. He's not had a tantrum or a whining fit since you made friends. Thenurse was just going to give up the case because she was so sick ofhim, but she says she doesn't mind staying now you've gone on duty withher,"" laughing a little.In her talks with Colin, Mary had tried to be very cautious about thesecret garden. There were certain things she wanted to find out fromhim, but she felt that she must find them out without asking him directquestions. In the first place, as she began to like to be with him, shewanted to discover whether he was the kind of boy you could tell asecret to. He was not in the least like Dickon, but he was evidently sopleased with the idea of a garden no one knew anything about that shethought perhaps he could be trusted. But she had not known him longenough to be sure. The second thing she wanted to find out was this: Ifhe could be trusted—if he really could—wouldn't it be possible to takehim to the garden without having any one find it out? The grand doctorhad said that he must have fresh air and Colin had said that he wouldnot mind fresh air in a secret garden. Perhaps if he had a great deal offresh air and knew Dickon and the robin and saw things growing he mightnot think so much about dying. Mary had seen herself in the glasssometimes lately when she had realized that she looked quite a differentcreature from the child she had seen when she arrived from India. Thischild looked nicer. Even Martha had seen a change in her.""Th' air from th' moor has done thee good already,"" she had said.""Tha'rt not nigh so yeller and tha'rt not nigh so scrawny. Even tha'hair doesn't slamp down on tha' head so flat. It's got some life in itso as it sticks out a bit.""""It's like me,"" said Mary. ""It's growing stronger and fatter. I'm surethere's more of it.""""It looks it, for sure,"" said Martha, ruffling it up a little round herface. ""Tha'rt not half so ugly when it's that way an' there's a bit o'red in tha' cheeks.""If gardens and fresh air had been good for her perhaps they would begood for Colin. But then, if he hated people to look at him, perhaps hewould not like to see Dickon.""Why does it make you angry when you are looked at?"" she inquired oneday.""I always hated it,"" he answered, ""even when I was very little. Thenwhen they took me to the seaside and I used to lie in my carriageeverybody used to stare and ladies would stop and talk to my nurse andthen they would begin to whisper and I knew then they were saying Ishouldn't live to grow up. Then sometimes the ladies would pat mycheeks and say 'Poor child!' Once when a lady did that I screamed outloud and bit her hand. She was so frightened she ran away.""""She thought you had gone mad like a dog,"" said Mary, not at alladmiringly.""I don't care what she thought,"" said Colin, frowning.""I wonder why you didn't scream and bite me when I came into your room?""said Mary. Then she began to smile slowly.""I thought you were a ghost or a dream,"" he said. ""You can't bite aghost or a dream, and if you scream they don't care.""""Would you hate it if—if a boy looked at you?"" Mary asked uncertainly.He lay back on his cushion and paused thoughtfully.""There's one boy,"" he said quite slowly, as if he were thinking overevery word, ""there's one boy I believe I shouldn't mind. It's that boywho knows where the foxes live—Dickon.""""I'm sure you wouldn't mind him,"" said Mary.""The birds don't and other animals,"" he said, still thinking it over,""perhaps that's why I shouldn't. He's a sort of animal charmer and I ama boy animal.""Then he laughed and she laughed too; in fact it ended in their bothlaughing a great deal and finding the idea of a boy animal hiding inhis hole very funny indeed.What Mary felt afterward was that she need not fear about Dickon.On that first morning when the sky was blue again Mary wakened veryearly. The sun was pouring in slanting rays through the blinds and therewas something so joyous in the sight of it that she jumped out of bedand ran to the window. She drew up the blinds and opened the windowitself and a great waft of fresh, scented air blew in upon her. The moorwas blue and the whole world looked as if something Magic had happenedto it. There were tender little fluting sounds here and there andeverywhere, as if scores of birds were beginning to tune up for aconcert. Mary put her hand out of the window and held it in the sun.""It's warm—warm!"" she said. ""It will make the green points push up andup and up, and it will make the bulbs and roots work and struggle withall their might under the earth.""She kneeled down and leaned out of the window as far as she could,breathing big breaths and sniffing the air until she laughed because sheremembered what Dickon's mother had said about the end of his nosequivering like a rabbit's.""It must be very early,"" she said. ""The little clouds are all pink andI've never seen the sky look like this. No one is up. I don't even hearthe stable boys.""A sudden thought made her scramble to her feet.""I can't wait! I am going to see the garden!""She had learned to dress herself by this time and she put on her clothesin five minutes. She knew a small side door which she could unboltherself and she flew down-stairs in her stocking feet and put on hershoes in the hall. She unchained and unbolted and unlocked and when thedoor was open she sprang across the step with one bound, and there shewas standing on the grass, which seemed to have turned green, and withthe sun pouring down on her and warm sweet wafts about her and thefluting and twittering and singing coming from every bush and tree. Sheclasped her hands for pure joy and looked up in the sky and it was soblue and pink and pearly and white and flooded with springtime lightthat she felt as if she must flute and sing aloud herself and knew thatthrushes and robins and skylarks could not possibly help it. She ranaround the shrubs and paths toward the secret garden.""It is all different already,"" she said. ""The grass is greener andthings are sticking up everywhere and things are uncurling and greenbuds of leaves are showing. This afternoon I am sure Dickon will come.""The long warm rain had done strange things to the herbaceous beds whichbordered the walk by the lower wall. There were things sprouting andpushing out from the roots of clumps of plants and there were actuallyhere and there glimpses of royal purple and yellow unfurling among thestems of crocuses. Six months before Mistress Mary would not have seenhow the world was waking up, but now she missed nothing.When she had reached the place where the door hid itself under the ivy,she was startled by a curious loud sound. It was the caw—caw of a crowand it came from the top of the wall, and when she looked up, there sata big glossy-plumaged blue-black bird, looking down at her very wiselyindeed. She had never seen a crow so close before and he made her alittle nervous, but the next moment he spread his wings and flapped awayacross the garden. She hoped he was not going to stay inside and shepushed the door open wondering if he would. When she got fairly into thegarden she saw that he probably did intend to stay because he hadalighted on a dwarf apple-tree, and under the apple-tree was lying alittle reddish animal with a bushy tail, and both of them were watchingthe stooping body and rust-red head of Dickon, who was kneeling on thegrass working hard.Mary flew across the grass to him.""Oh, Dickon! Dickon!"" she cried out. ""How could you get here so early!How could you! The sun has only just got up!""He got up himself, laughing and glowing, and tousled; his eyes like abit of the sky.""Eh!"" he said. ""I was up long before him. How could I have stayed abed!Th' world's all fair begun again this mornin', it has. An' it's workin'an' hummin' an' scratchin' an' pipin' an' nest-buildin' an' breathin'out scents, till you've got to be out on it 'stead o' lyin' on yourback. When th' sun did jump up, th' moor went mad for joy, an' I was inthe midst of th' heather, an' I run like mad myself, shoutin' an'singin'. An' I come straight here. I couldn't have stayed away. Why, th'garden was lyin' here waitin'!""Mary put her hands on her chest, panting, as if she had been runningherself.""Oh, Dickon! Dickon!"" she said. ""I'm so happy I can scarcely breathe!""Seeing him talking to a stranger, the little bushy-tailed animal rosefrom its place under the tree and came to him, and the rook, cawingonce, flew down from its branch and settled quietly on his shoulder.""This is th' little fox cub,"" he said, rubbing the little reddishanimal's head. ""It's named Captain. An' this here's Soot. Soot he flewacross th' moor with me an' Captain he run same as if th' hounds hadbeen after him. They both felt same as I did.""Neither of the creatures looked as if he were the least afraid of Mary.When Dickon began to walk about, Soot stayed on his shoulder and Captaintrotted quietly close to his side.""See here!"" said Dickon. ""See how these has pushed up, an' these an'these! An' Eh! look at these here!""He threw himself upon his knees and Mary went down beside him. They hadcome upon a whole clump of crocuses burst into purple and orange andgold. Mary bent her face down and kissed and kissed them.""You never kiss a person in that way,"" she said when she lifted herhead. ""Flowers are so different.""He looked puzzled but smiled.""Eh!"" he said, ""I've kissed mother many a time that way when I come infrom th' moor after a day's roamin' an' she stood there at th' door inth' sun, lookin' so glad an' comfortable.""They ran from one part of the garden to another and found so manywonders that they were obliged to remind themselves that they mustwhisper or speak low. He showed her swelling leaf-buds on rose brancheswhich had seemed dead. He showed her ten thousand new green pointspushing through the mould. They put their eager young noses close to theearth and sniffed its warmed springtime breathing; they dug and pulledand laughed low with rapture until Mistress Mary's hair was as tumbledas Dickon's and her cheeks were almost as poppy red as his.There was every joy on earth in the secret garden that morning, and inthe midst of them came a delight more delightful than all, because itwas more wonderful. Swiftly something flew across the wall and dartedthrough the trees to a close grown corner, a little flare ofred-breasted bird with something hanging from its beak. Dickon stoodquite still and put his hand on Mary almost as if they had suddenlyfound themselves laughing in a church.""We munnot stir,"" he whispered in broad Yorkshire. ""We munnot scarcebreathe. I knowed he was mate-huntin' when I seed him last. It's BenWeatherstaff's robin. He's buildin' his nest. He'll stay here if usdon't flight him.""They settled down softly upon the grass and sat there without moving.""Us mustn't seem as if us was watchin' him too close,"" said Dickon.""He'd be out with us for good if he got th' notion us was interferin'now. He'll be a good bit different till all this is over. He's settin'up housekeepin'. He'll be shyer an' readier to take things ill. He's gotno time for visitin' an' gossipin'. Us must keep still a bit an' try tolook as if us was grass an' trees an' bushes. Then when he's got used toseein' us I'll chirp a bit an' he'll know us'll not be in his way.""Mistress Mary was not at all sure that she knew, as Dickon seemed to,how to try to look like grass and trees and bushes. But he had said thequeer thing as if it were the simplest and most natural thing in theworld, and she felt it must be quite easy to him, and indeed she watchedhim for a few minutes carefully, wondering if it was possible for him toquietly turn green and put out branches and leaves. But he only satwonderfully still, and when he spoke dropped his voice to such asoftness that it was curious that she could hear him, but she could.""It's part o' th' springtime, this nest-buildin' is,"" he said. ""Iwarrant it's been goin' on in th' same way every year since th' worldwas begun. They've got their way o' thinkin' and doin' things an' abody had better not meddle. You can lose a friend in springtime easierthan any other season if you're too curious.""""If we talk about him I can't help looking at him,"" Mary said as softlyas possible. ""We must talk of something else. There is something I wantto tell you.""""He'll like it better if us talks o' somethin' else,"" said Dickon. ""Whatis it tha's got to tell me?""""Well—do you know about Colin?"" she whispered.He turned his head to look at her.""What does tha' know about him?"" he asked.""I've seen him. I have been to talk to him every day this week. He wantsme to come. He says I'm making him forget about being ill and dying,""answered Mary.Dickon looked actually relieved as soon as the surprise died away fromhis round face.""I am glad o' that,"" he exclaimed. ""I'm right down glad. It makes meeasier. I knowed I must say nothin' about him an' I don't like havin' tohide things.""""Don't you like hiding the garden?"" said Mary.""I'll never tell about it,"" he answered. ""But I says to mother,'Mother,' I says, 'I got a secret to keep. It's not a bad 'un, tha'knows that. It's no worse than hidin' where a bird's nest is. Tha'doesn't mind it, does tha'?'""Mary always wanted to hear about mother.""What did she say?"" she asked, not at all afraid to hear.Dickon grinned sweet-temperedly.""It was just like her, what she said,"" he answered. ""She give my head abit of a rub an' laughed an' she says, 'Eh, lad, tha' can have all th'secrets tha' likes. I've knowed thee twelve year'.'""""How did you know about Colin?"" asked Mary.""Everybody as knowed about Mester Craven knowed there was a little ladas was like to be a cripple, an' they knowed Mester Craven didn't likehim to be talked about. Folks is sorry for Mester Craven because Mrs.Craven was such a pretty young lady an' they was so fond of each other.Mrs. Medlock stops in our cottage whenever she goes to Thwaite an' shedoesn't mind talkin' to mother before us children, because she knows ushas been brought up to be trusty. How did tha' find out about him?Martha was in fine trouble th' last time she came home. She said tha'dheard him frettin' an' tha' was askin' questions an' she didn't knowwhat to say.""Mary told him her story about the midnight wuthering of the wind whichhad wakened her and about the faint far-off sounds of the complainingvoice which had led her down the dark corridors with her candle and hadended with her opening of the door of the dimly lighted room with thecarven four-posted bed in the corner. When she described the smallivory-white face and the strange black-rimmed eyes Dickon shook hishead.""Them's just like his mother's eyes, only hers was always laughin', theysay,"" he said. ""They say as Mr. Craven can't bear to see him when he'sawake an' it's because his eyes is so like his mother's an' yet looks sodifferent in his miserable bit of a face.""""Do you think he wants him to die?"" whispered Mary.""No, but he wishes he'd never been born. Mother she says that's th'worst thing on earth for a child. Them as is not wanted scarce everthrives. Mester Craven he'd buy anythin' as money could buy for th' poorlad but he'd like to forget as he's on earth. For one thing, he's afraidhe'll look at him some day and find he's growed hunchback.""""Colin's so afraid of it himself that he won't sit up,"" said Mary. ""Hesays he's always thinking that if he should feel a lump coming heshould go crazy and scream himself to death.""""Eh! he oughtn't to lie there thinkin' things like that,"" said Dickon.""No lad could get well as thought them sort o' things.""The fox was lying on the grass close by him looking up to ask for a patnow and then, and Dickon bent down and rubbed his neck softly andthought a few minutes in silence. Presently he lifted his head andlooked round the garden.""When first we got in here,"" he said, ""it seemed like everything wasgray. Look round now and tell me if tha' doesn't see a difference.""Mary looked and caught her breath a little.""Why!"" she cried, ""the gray wall is changing. It is as if a green mistwere creeping over it. It's almost like a green gauze veil.""""Aye,"" said Dickon. ""An' it'll be greener and greener till th' gray'sall gone. Can tha' guess what I was thinkin'?""""I know it was something nice,"" said Mary eagerly. ""I believe it wassomething about Colin.""""I was thinkin' that if he was out here he wouldn't be watchin' forlumps to grow on his back; he'd be watchin' for buds to break on th'rose-bushes, an' he'd likely be healthier,"" explained Dickon. ""I waswonderin' if us could ever get him in th' humor to come out here an'lie under th' trees in his carriage.""""I've been wondering that myself. I've thought of it almost every timeI've talked to him,"" said Mary. ""I've wondered if he could keep a secretand I've wondered if we could bring him here without any one seeing us.I thought perhaps you could push his carriage. The doctor said he musthave fresh air and if he wants us to take him out no one dare disobeyhim. He won't go out for other people and perhaps they will be glad ifhe will go out with us. He could order the gardeners to keep away sothey wouldn't find out.""Dickon was thinking very hard as he scratched Captain's back.""It'd be good for him, I'll warrant,"" he said. ""Us'd not be thinkin'he'd better never been born. Us'd be just two children watchin' a gardengrow, an' he'd be another. Two lads an' a little lass just lookin' on atth' springtime. I warrant it'd be better than doctor's stuff.""""He's been lying in his room so long and he's always been so afraid ofhis back that it has made him queer,"" said Mary. ""He knows a good manythings out of books but he doesn't know anything else. He says he hasbeen too ill to notice things and he hates going out of doors and hatesgardens and gardeners. But he likes to hear about this garden becauseit is a secret. I daren't tell him much but he said he wanted to seeit.""""Us'll have him out here sometime for sure,"" said Dickon. ""I could pushhis carriage well enough. Has tha' noticed how th' robin an' his matehas been workin' while we've been sittin' here? Look at him perched onthat branch wonderin' where it'd be best to put that twig he's got inhis beak.""He made one of his low whistling calls and the robin turned his head andlooked at him inquiringly, still holding his twig. Dickon spoke to himas Ben Weatherstaff did, but Dickon's tone was one of friendly advice.""Wheres'ever tha' puts it,"" he said, ""it'll be all right. Tha' knew howto build tha' nest before tha' came out o' th' egg. Get on with thee,lad. Tha'st got no time to lose.""""Oh, I do like to hear you talk to him!"" Mary said, laughingdelightedly. ""Ben Weatherstaff scolds him and makes fun of him, and hehops about and looks as if he understood every word, and I know he likesit. Ben Weatherstaff says he is so conceited he would rather have stonesthrown at him than not be noticed.""Dickon laughed too and went on talking.""Tha' knows us won't trouble thee,"" he said to the robin. ""Us is nearbein' wild things ourselves. Us is nest-buildin' too, bless thee. Lookout tha' doesn't tell on us.""And though the robin did not answer, because his beak was occupied, Maryknew that when he flew away with his twig to his own corner of thegarden the darkness of his dew-bright eye meant that he would not telltheir secret for the world."

SAID MARY","They found a great deal to do that morning and Mary was late inreturning to the house and was also in such a hurry to get back to herwork that she quite forgot Colin until the last moment.""Tell Colin that I can't come and see him yet,"" she said to Martha. ""I'mvery busy in the garden.""Martha looked rather frightened.""Eh! Miss Mary,"" she said, ""it may put him all out of humor when I tellhim that.""But Mary was not as afraid of him as other people were and she was not aself-sacrificing person.""I can't stay,"" she answered. ""Dickon's waiting for me;"" and she ranaway.The afternoon was even lovelier and busier than the morning had been.Already nearly all the weeds were cleared out of the garden and most ofthe roses and trees had been pruned or dug about. Dickon had brought aspade of his own and he had taught Mary to use all her tools, so thatby this time it was plain that though the lovely wild place was notlikely to become a ""gardener's garden"" it would be a wilderness ofgrowing things before the springtime was over.""There'll be apple blossoms an' cherry blossoms overhead,"" Dickon said,working away with all his might. ""An' there'll be peach an' plum treesin bloom against th' walls, an' th' grass'll be a carpet o' flowers.""The little fox and the rook were as happy and busy as they were, and therobin and his mate flew backward and forward like tiny streaks oflightning. Sometimes the rook flapped his black wings and soared awayover the tree-tops in the park. Each time he came back and perched nearDickon and cawed several times as if he were relating his adventures,and Dickon talked to him just as he had talked to the robin. Once whenDickon was so busy that he did not answer him at first, Soot flew on tohis shoulders and gently tweaked his ear with his large beak. When Marywanted to rest a little Dickon sat down with her under a tree and oncehe took his pipe out of his pocket and played the soft strange littlenotes and two squirrels appeared on the wall and looked and listened.""Tha's a good bit stronger than tha' was,"" Dickon said, looking at heras she was digging. ""Tha's beginning to look different, for sure.""Mary was glowing with exercise and good spirits.""I'm getting fatter and fatter every day,"" she said quite exultantly.""Mrs. Medlock will have to get me some bigger dresses. Martha says myhair is growing thicker. It isn't so flat and stringy.""The sun was beginning to set and sending deep gold-colored rays slantingunder the trees when they parted.""It'll be fine to-morrow,"" said Dickon. ""I'll be at work by sunrise.""""So will I,"" said Mary.She ran back to the house as quickly as her feet would carry her. Shewanted to tell Colin about Dickon's fox cub and the rook and about whatthe springtime had been doing. She felt sure he would like to hear. Soit was not very pleasant when she opened the door of her room, to seeMartha standing waiting for her with a doleful face.""What is the matter?"" she asked. ""What did Colin say when you told him Icouldn't come?""""Eh!"" said Martha, ""I wish tha'd gone. He was nigh goin' into one o'his tantrums. There's been a nice to do all afternoon to keep him quiet.He would watch the clock all th' time.""Mary's lips pinched themselves together. She was no more used toconsidering other people than Colin was and she saw no reason why anill-tempered boy should interfere with the thing she liked best. Sheknew nothing about the pitifulness of people who had been ill andnervous and who did not know that they could control their tempers andneed not make other people ill and nervous, too. When she had had aheadache in India she had done her best to see that everybody else alsohad a headache or something quite as bad. And she felt she was quiteright; but of course now she felt that Colin was quite wrong.He was not on his sofa when she went into his room. He was lying flat onhis back in bed and he did not turn his head toward her as she came in.This was a bad beginning and Mary marched up to him with her stiffmanner.""Why didn't you get up?"" she said.""I did get up this morning when I thought you were coming,"" he answered,without looking at her. ""I made them put me back in bed this afternoon.My back ached and my head ached and I was tired. Why didn't you come?""""I was working in the garden with Dickon,"" said Mary.Colin frowned and condescended to look at her.""I won't let that boy come here if you go and stay with him instead ofcoming to talk to me,"" he said.Mary flew into a fine passion. She could fly into a passion withoutmaking a noise. She just grew sour and obstinate and did not care whathappened.""If you send Dickon away, I'll never come into this room again!"" sheretorted.""You'll have to if I want you,"" said Colin.""I won't!"" said Mary.""I'll make you,"" said Colin, ""They shall drag you in.""""Shall they, Mr. Rajah!"" said Mary fiercely. ""They may drag me in butthey can't make me talk when they get me here. I'll sit and clench myteeth and never tell you one thing. I won't even look at you. I'll stareat the floor!""They were a nice agreeable pair as they glared at each other. If theyhad been two little street boys they would have sprung at each other andhad a rough-and-tumble fight. As it was, they did the next thing to it.""You are a selfish thing!"" cried Colin.""What are you?"" said Mary. ""Selfish people always say that. Any one isselfish who doesn't do what they want. You're more selfish than I am.You're the most selfish boy I ever saw.""""I'm not!"" snapped Colin. ""I'm not as selfish as your fine Dickon is! Hekeeps you playing in the dirt when he knows I am all by myself. He'sselfish, if you like!""Mary's eyes flashed fire.""He's nicer than any other boy that ever lived!"" she said. ""He's—he'slike an angel!"" It might sound rather silly to say that but she did notcare.""A nice angel!"" Colin sneered ferociously. ""He's a common cottage boyoff the moor!""""He's better than a common Rajah!"" retorted Mary. ""He's a thousand timesbetter!""Because she was the stronger of the two she was beginning to get thebetter of him. The truth was that he had never had a fight with any onelike himself in his life and, upon the whole, it was rather good forhim, though neither he nor Mary knew anything about that. He turned hishead on his pillow and shut his eyes and a big tear was squeezed out andran down his cheek. He was beginning to feel pathetic and sorry forhimself—not for any one else.""I'm not as selfish as you, because I'm always ill, and I'm sure thereis a lump coming on my back,"" he said. ""And I am going to die besides.""""You're not!"" contradicted Mary unsympathetically.He opened his eyes quite wide with indignation. He had never heard sucha thing said before. He was at once furious and slightly pleased, if aperson could be both at the same time.""I'm not?"" he cried. ""I am! You know I am! Everybody says so.""""I don't believe it!"" said Mary sourly. ""You just say that to makepeople sorry. I believe you're proud of it. I don't believe it! If youwere a nice boy it might be true—but you're too nasty!""In spite of his invalid back Colin sat up in bed in quite a healthyrage.""Get out of the room!"" he shouted and he caught hold of his pillow andthrew it at her. He was not strong enough to throw it far and it onlyfell at her feet, but Mary's face looked as pinched as a nutcracker.""I'm going,"" she said. ""And I won't come back!""She walked to the door and when she reached it she turned round andspoke again.""I was going to tell you all sorts of nice things,"" she said. ""Dickonbrought his fox and his rook and I was going to tell you all aboutthem. Now I won't tell you a single thing!""She marched out of the door and closed it behind her, and there to hergreat astonishment she found the trained nurse standing as if she hadbeen listening and, more amazing still—she was laughing. She was a bighandsome young woman who ought not to have been a trained nurse at all,as she could not bear invalids and she was always making excuses toleave Colin to Martha or any one else who would take her place. Mary hadnever liked her, and she simply stood and gazed up at her as she stoodgiggling into her handkerchief.""What are you laughing at?"" she asked her.""At you two young ones,"" said the nurse. ""It's the best thing that couldhappen to the sickly pampered thing to have some one to stand up to himthat's as spoiled as himself;"" and she laughed into her handkerchiefagain. ""If he'd had a young vixen of a sister to fight with it wouldhave been the saving of him.""""Is he going to die?""""I don't know and I don't care,"" said the nurse. ""Hysterics and temperare half what ails him.""""What are hysterics?"" asked Mary.""You'll find out if you work him into a tantrum after this—but at anyrate you've given him something to have hysterics about, and I'm gladof it.""Mary went back to her room not feeling at all as she had felt when shehad come in from the garden. She was cross and disappointed but not atall sorry for Colin. She had looked forward to telling him a great manythings and she had meant to try to make up her mind whether it would besafe to trust him with the great secret. She had been beginning to thinkit would be, but now she had changed her mind entirely. She would nevertell him and he could stay in his room and never get any fresh air anddie if he liked! It would serve him right! She felt so sour andunrelenting that for a few minutes she almost forgot about Dickon andthe green veil creeping over the world and the soft wind blowing downfrom the moor.Martha was waiting for her and the trouble in her face had beentemporarily replaced by interest and curiosity. There was a wooden boxon the table and its cover had been removed and revealed that it wasfull of neat packages.""Mr. Craven sent it to you,"" said Martha. ""It looks as if it hadpicture-books in it.""Mary remembered what he had asked her the day she had gone to his room.""Do you want anything—dolls—toys—books?"" She opened the packagewondering if he had sent a doll, and also wondering what she should dowith it if he had. But he had not sent one. There were several beautifulbooks such as Colin had, and two of them were about gardens and werefull of pictures. There were two or three games and there was abeautiful little writing-case with a gold monogram on it and a gold penand inkstand.Everything was so nice that her pleasure began to crowd her anger out ofher mind. She had not expected him to remember her at all and her hardlittle heart grew quite warm.""I can write better than I can print,"" she said, ""and the first thing Ishall write with that pen will be a letter to tell him I am muchobliged.""If she had been friends with Colin she would have run to show him herpresents at once, and they would have looked at the pictures and readsome of the gardening books and perhaps tried playing the games, and hewould have enjoyed himself so much he would never once have thought hewas going to die or have put his hand on his spine to see if there was alump coming. He had a way of doing that which she could not bear. Itgave her an uncomfortable frightened feeling because he always looked sofrightened himself. He said that if he felt even quite a little lumpsome day he should know his hunch had begun to grow. Something he hadheard Mrs. Medlock whispering to the nurse had given him the idea and hehad thought over it in secret until it was quite firmly fixed in hismind. Mrs. Medlock had said his father's back had begun to show itscrookedness in that way when he was a child. He had never told any onebut Mary that most of his ""tantrums"" as they called them grew out of hishysterical hidden fear. Mary had been sorry for him when he had toldher.""He always began to think about it when he was cross or tired,"" she saidto herself. ""And he has been cross to-day. Perhaps—perhaps he has beenthinking about it all afternoon.""She stood still, looking down at the carpet and thinking.""I said I would never go back again—"" she hesitated, knitting herbrows—""but perhaps, just perhaps, I will go and see—if he wants me—inthe morning. Perhaps he'll try to throw his pillow at me again, but—Ithink—I'll go."""

As she laidher head on the pillow she murmured to herself:""I'll go out before breakfast and work with Dickon and then afterward—Ibelieve—I'll go to see him.""She thought it was the middle of the night when she was wakened by suchdreadful sounds that she jumped out of bed in an instant. What wasit—what was it? The next minute she felt quite sure she knew. Doorswere opened and shut and there were hurrying feet in the corridors andsome one was crying and screaming at the same time, screaming and cryingin a horrible way.""It's Colin,"" she said. ""He's having one of those tantrums the nursecalled hysterics. How awful it sounds.""As she listened to the sobbing screams she did not wonder that peoplewere so frightened that they gave him his own way in everything ratherthan hear them. She put her hands over her ears and felt sick andshivering.""I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do,"" she kept saying. ""Ican't bear it.""Once she wondered if he would stop if she dared go to him and then sheremembered how he had driven her out of the room and thought thatperhaps the sight of her might make him worse. Even when she pressed herhands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful soundsout. She hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly theybegan to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into atantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her. She was notused to any one's tempers but her own. She took her hands from her earsand sprang up and stamped her foot.""He ought to be stopped! Somebody ought to make him stop! Somebody oughtto beat him!"" she cried out.Just then she heard feet almost running down the corridor and her dooropened and the nurse came in. She was not laughing now by any means. Sheeven looked rather pale.""He's worked himself into hysterics,"" she said in a great hurry. ""He'lldo himself harm. No one can do anything with him. You come and try,like a good child. He likes you.""""He turned me out of the room this morning,"" said Mary, stamping herfoot with excitement.The stamp rather pleased the nurse. The truth was that she had beenafraid she might find Mary crying and hiding her head under thebed-clothes.""That's right,"" she said. ""You're in the right humor. You go and scoldhim. Give him something new to think of. Do go, child, as quick as everyou can.""It was not until afterward that Mary realized that the thing had beenfunny as well as dreadful—that it was funny that all the grown-uppeople were so frightened that they came to a little girl just becausethey guessed she was almost as bad as Colin himself.She flew along the corridor and the nearer she got to the screams thehigher her temper mounted. She felt quite wicked by the time she reachedthe door. She slapped it open with her hand and ran across the room tothe four-posted bed.""You stop!"" she almost shouted. ""You stop! I hate you! Everybody hatesyou! I wish everybody would run out of the house and let you screamyourself to death! You will scream yourself to death in a minute, andI wish you would!""A nice sympathetic child could neither have thought nor said suchthings, but it just happened that the shock of hearing them was the bestpossible thing for this hysterical boy whom no one had ever dared torestrain or contradict.He had been lying on his face beating his pillow with his hands and heactually almost jumped around, he turned so quickly at the sound of thefurious little voice. His face looked dreadful, white and red andswollen, and he was gasping and choking; but savage little Mary did notcare an atom.""If you scream another scream,"" she said, ""I'll scream too—and I canscream louder than you can and I'll frighten you, I'll frighten you!""He actually had stopped screaming because she had startled him so. Thescream which had been coming almost choked him. The tears were streamingdown his face and he shook all over.""I can't stop!"" he gasped and sobbed. ""I can't—I can't!""""You can!"" shouted Mary. ""Half that ails you is hysterics andtemper—just hysterics—hysterics—hysterics!"" and she stamped each timeshe said it.""I felt the lump—I felt it,"" choked out Colin. ""I knew I should. Ishall have a hunch on my back and then I shall die,"" and he began towrithe again and turned on his face and sobbed and wailed but he didn'tscream.""You didn't feel a lump!"" contradicted Mary fiercely. ""If you did it wasonly a hysterical lump. Hysterics makes lumps. There's nothing thematter with your horrid back—nothing but hysterics! Turn over and letme look at it!""She liked the word ""hysterics"" and felt somehow as if it had an effecton him. He was probably like herself and had never heard it before.""Nurse,"" she commanded, ""come here and show me his back this minute!""The nurse, Mrs. Medlock and Martha had been standing huddled togethernear the door staring at her, their mouths half open. All three hadgasped with fright more than once. The nurse came forward as if she werehalf afraid. Colin was heaving with great breathless sobs.""Perhaps he—he won't let me,"" she hesitated in a low voice.Colin heard her, however, and he gasped out between two sobs:""Sh—show her! She—she'll see then!""It was a poor thin back to look at when it was bared. Every rib could becounted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not countthem as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage littleface. She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned herhead aside to hide the twitching of her mouth. There was just a minute'ssilence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary looked upand down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she had been thegreat doctor from London.""There's not a single lump there!"" she said at last. ""There's not a lumpas big as a pin—except backbone lumps, and you can only feel thembecause you're thin. I've got backbone lumps myself, and they used tostick out as much as yours do, until I began to get fatter, and I am notfat enough yet to hide them. There's not a lump as big as a pin! If youever say there is again, I shall laugh!""No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childishwords had on him. If he had ever had any one to talk to about his secretterrors—if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions—if he hadhad childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closedhouse, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who weremost of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out thatmost of his fright and illness was created by himself. But he had lainand thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and daysand months and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girlinsisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was heactually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.""I didn't know,"" ventured the nurse, ""that he thought he had a lump onhis spine. His back is weak because he won't try to sit up. I could havetold him there was no lump there.""Colin gulped and turned his face a little to look at her.""C-could you?"" he said pathetically.""Yes, sir.""""There!"" said Mary, and she gulped too.Colin turned on his face again and but for his long-drawn brokenbreaths, which were the dying down of his storm of sobbing, he lay stillfor a minute, though great tears streamed down his face and wet thepillow. Actually the tears meant that a curious great relief had come tohim. Presently he turned and looked at the nurse again and strangelyenough he was not like a Rajah at all as he spoke to her.""Do you think—I could—live to grow up?"" he said.The nurse was neither clever nor soft-hearted but she could repeat someof the London doctor's words.""You probably will if you will do what you are told to do and not giveway to your temper, and stay out a great deal in the fresh air.""Colin's tantrum had passed and he was weak and worn out with crying andthis perhaps made him feel gentle. He put out his hand a little towardMary, and I am glad to say that, her own tantrum having passed, she wassoftened too and met him half-way with her hand, so that it was a sortof making up.""I'll—I'll go out with you, Mary,"" he said. ""I shan't hate fresh air ifwe can find—"" He remembered just in time to stop himself from saying""if we can find the secret garden"" and he ended, ""I shall like to go outwith you if Dickon will come and push my chair. I do so want to seeDickon and the fox and the crow.""The nurse remade the tumbled bed and shook and straightened the pillows.Then she made Colin a cup of beef tea and gave a cup to Mary, who reallywas very glad to get it after her excitement. Mrs. Medlock and Marthagladly slipped away, and after everything was neat and calm and in orderthe nurse looked as if she would very gladly slip away also. She was ahealthy young woman who resented being robbed of her sleep and sheyawned quite openly as she looked at Mary, who had pushed her bigfootstool close to the four-posted bed and was holding Colin's hand.""You must go back and get your sleep out,"" she said. ""He'll drop offafter a while—if he's not too upset. Then I'll lie down myself in thenext room.""""Would you like me to sing you that song I learned from my Ayah?"" Marywhispered to Colin.His hand pulled hers gently and he turned his tired eyes on herappealingly.""Oh, yes!"" he answered. ""It's such a soft song. I shall go to sleep in aminute.""""I will put him to sleep,"" Mary said to the yawning nurse. ""You can goif you like.""""Well,"" said the nurse, with an attempt at reluctance. ""If he doesn't goto sleep in half an hour you must call me.""""Very well,"" answered Mary.The nurse was out of the room in a minute and as soon as she was goneColin pulled Mary's hand again.""I almost told,"" he said; ""but I stopped myself in time. I won't talkand I'll go to sleep, but you said you had a whole lot of nice things totell me. Have you—do you think you have found out anything at all aboutthe way into the secret garden?""Mary looked at his poor little tired face and swollen eyes and her heartrelented.""Ye-es,"" she answered, ""I think I have. And if you will go to sleep Iwill tell you to-morrow.""His hand quite trembled.""Oh, Mary!"" he said. ""Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I shouldlive to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayahsong—you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what youimagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep.""""Yes,"" answered Mary. ""Shut your eyes.""He closed his eyes and lay quite still and she held his hand and beganto speak very slowly and in a very low voice.""I think it has been left alone so long—that it has grown all into alovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbeduntil they hang from the branches and walls and creep over theground—almost like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died butmany—are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains andfountains of roses. I think the ground is full of daffodils andsnowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark. Now thespring has begun—perhaps—perhaps—""The soft drone of her voice was making him stiller and stiller and shesaw it and went on.""Perhaps they are coming up through the grass—perhaps there areclusters of purple crocuses and gold ones—even now. Perhaps the leavesare beginning to break out and uncurl—and perhaps—the gray is changingand a green gauze veil is creeping—and creeping over—everything. Andthe birds are coming to look at it—because it is—so safe and still.And perhaps—perhaps—perhaps—"" very softly and slowly indeed, ""therobin has found a mate—and is building a nest.""And Colin was asleep."

She slept latebecause she was tired, and when Martha brought her breakfast she toldher that though Colin was quite quiet he was ill and feverish as healways was after he had worn himself out with a fit of crying. Mary ateher breakfast slowly as she listened.""He says he wishes tha' would please go and see him as soon as tha'can,"" Martha said. ""It's queer what a fancy he's took to thee. Tha' didgive it him last night for sure—didn't tha'? Nobody else would havedared to do it. Eh! poor lad! He's been spoiled till salt won't savehim. Mother says as th' two worst things as can happen to a child isnever to have his own way—or always to have it. She doesn't know whichis th' worst. Tha' was in a fine temper tha'self, too. But he says to mewhen I went into his room, 'Please ask Miss Mary if she'll please comean' talk to me?' Think o' him saying please! Will you go, Miss?""""I'll run and see Dickon first,"" said Mary. ""No, I'll go and see Colinfirst and tell him—I know what I'll tell him,"" with a suddeninspiration.She had her hat on when she appeared in Colin's room and for a second helooked disappointed. He was in bed and his face was pitifully white andthere were dark circles round his eyes.""I'm glad you came,"" he said. ""My head aches and I ache all over becauseI'm so tired. Are you going somewhere?""Mary went and leaned against his bed.""I won't be long,"" she said. ""I'm going to Dickon, but I'll come back.Colin, it's—it's something about the secret garden.""His whole face brightened and a little color came into it.""Oh! is it!"" he cried out. ""I dreamed about it all night. I heard yousay something about gray changing into green, and I dreamed I wasstanding in a place all filled with trembling little green leaves—andthere were birds on nests everywhere and they looked so soft and still.I'll lie and think about it until you come back.""In five minutes Mary was with Dickon in their garden. The fox and thecrow were with him again and this time he had brought two tamesquirrels.""I came over on the pony this mornin',"" he said. ""Eh! he is a goodlittle chap—Jump is! I brought these two in my pockets. This here onehe's called Nut an' this here other one's called Shell.""When he said ""Nut"" one squirrel leaped on to his right shoulder and whenhe said ""Shell"" the other one leaped on to his left shoulder.When they sat down on the grass with Captain curled at their feet, Sootsolemnly listening on a tree and Nut and Shell nosing about close tothem, it seemed to Mary that it would be scarcely bearable to leave suchdelightfulness, but when she began to tell her story somehow the look inDickon's funny face gradually changed her mind. She could see he feltsorrier for Colin than she did. He looked up at the sky and all abouthim.""Just listen to them birds—th' world seems full of 'em—all whistlin'an' pipin',"" he said. ""Look at 'em dartin' about, an' hearken at 'emcallin' to each other. Come springtime seems like as if all th' world'scallin'. The leaves is uncurlin' so you can see 'em—an', my word, th'nice smells there is about!"" sniffing with his happy turned-up nose.""An' that poor lad lyin' shut up an' seein' so little that he gets tothinkin' o' things as sets him screamin'. Eh! my! we mun get him outhere—we mun get him watchin' an' listenin' an' sniffin' up th' air an'get him just soaked through wi' sunshine. An' we munnot lose no timeabout it.""When he was very much interested he often spoke quite broad Yorkshirethough at other times he tried to modify his dialect so that Mary couldbetter understand. But she loved his broad Yorkshire and had in factbeen trying to learn to speak it herself. So she spoke a little now.""Aye, that we mun,"" she said (which meant ""Yes, indeed, we must""). ""I'lltell thee what us'll do first,"" she proceeded, and Dickon grinned,because when the little wench tried to twist her tongue into speakingYorkshire it amused him very much. ""He's took a graidely fancy to thee.He wants to see thee and he wants to see Soot an' Captain. When I goback to the house to talk to him I'll ax him if tha' canna' come an' seehim to-morrow mornin'—an' bring tha' creatures wi' thee—an' then—in abit, when there's more leaves out, an' happen a bud or two, we'll gethim to come out an' tha' shall push him in his chair an' we'll bring himhere an' show him everything.""When she stopped she was quite proud of herself. She had never made along speech in Yorkshire before and she had remembered very well.""Tha' mun talk a bit o' Yorkshire like that to Mester Colin,"" Dickonchuckled. ""Tha'll make him laugh an' there's nowt as good for ill folkas laughin' is. Mother says she believes as half a hour's good laughevery mornin' 'ud cure a chap as was makin' ready for typhus fever.""""I'm going to talk Yorkshire to him this very day,"" said Mary, chucklingherself.The garden had reached the time when every day and every night it seemedas if Magicians were passing through it drawing loveliness out of theearth and the boughs with wands. It was hard to go away and leave itall, particularly as Nut had actually crept on to her dress and Shellhad scrambled down the trunk of the apple-tree they sat under and stayedthere looking at her with inquiring eyes. But she went back to the houseand when she sat down close to Colin's bed he began to sniff as Dickondid though not in such an experienced way.""You smell like flowers and—and fresh things,"" he cried out quitejoyously. ""What is it you smell of? It's cool and warm and sweet all atthe same time.""""It's th' wind from th' moor,"" said Mary. ""It comes o' sittin' on th'grass under a tree wi' Dickon an' wi' Captain an' Soot an' Nut an'Shell. It's th' springtime an' out o' doors an' sunshine as smells sograidely.""She said it as broadly as she could, and you do not know how broadlyYorkshire sounds until you have heard some one speak it. Colin began tolaugh.""What are you doing?"" he said. ""I never heard you talk like that before.How funny it sounds.""""I'm givin' thee a bit o' Yorkshire,"" answered Mary triumphantly. ""Icanna' talk as graidely as Dickon an' Martha can but tha' sees I canshape a bit. Doesn't tha' understand a bit o' Yorkshire when tha' hearsit? An' tha' a Yorkshire lad thysel' bred an' born! Eh! I wonder tha'rtnot ashamed o' thy face.""And then she began to laugh too and they both laughed until they couldnot stop themselves and they laughed until the room echoed and Mrs.Medlock opening the door to come in drew back into the corridor andstood listening amazed.""Well, upon my word!"" she said, speaking rather broad Yorkshire herselfbecause there was no one to hear her and she was so astonished. ""Whoeverheard th' like! Whoever on earth would ha' thought it!""There was so much to talk about. It seemed as if Colin could never hearenough of Dickon and Captain and Soot and Nut and Shell and the ponywhose name was Jump. Mary had run round into the wood with Dickon to seeJump. He was a tiny little shaggy moor pony with thick locks hangingover his eyes and with a pretty face and a nuzzling velvet nose. He wasrather thin with living on moor grass but he was as tough and wiry as ifthe muscle in his little legs had been made of steel springs. He hadlifted his head and whinnied softly the moment he saw Dickon and he hadtrotted up to him and put his head across his shoulder and then Dickonhad talked into his ear and Jump had talked back in odd little whinniesand puffs and snorts. Dickon had made him give Mary his small front hoofand kiss her on her cheek with his velvet muzzle.""Does he really understand everything Dickon says?"" Colin asked.""It seems as if he does,"" answered Mary. ""Dickon says anything willunderstand if you're friends with it for sure, but you have to befriends for sure.""Colin lay quiet a little while and his strange gray eyes seemed to bestaring at the wall, but Mary saw he was thinking.""I wish I was friends with things,"" he said at last, ""but I'm not. Inever had anything to be friends with, and I can't bear people.""""Can't you bear me?"" asked Mary.""Yes, I can,"" he answered. ""It's very funny but I even like you.""""Ben Weatherstaff said I was like him,"" said Mary. ""He said he'd warrantwe'd both got the same nasty tempers. I think you are like him too. Weare all three alike—you and I and Ben Weatherstaff. He said we wereneither of us much to look at and we were as sour as we looked. But Idon't feel as sour as I used to before I knew the robin and Dickon.""""Did you feel as if you hated people?""""Yes,"" answered Mary without any affectation. ""I should have detestedyou if I had seen you before I saw the robin and Dickon.""Colin put out his thin hand and touched her.""Mary,"" he said, ""I wish I hadn't said what I did about sending Dickonaway. I hated you when you said he was like an angel and I laughed atyou but—but perhaps he is.""""Well, it was rather funny to say it,"" she admitted frankly, ""becausehis nose does turn up and he has a big mouth and his clothes havepatches all over them and he talks broad Yorkshire, but—but if an angeldid come to Yorkshire and live on the moor—if there was a Yorkshireangel—I believe he'd understand the green things and know how to makethem grow and he would know how to talk to the wild creatures as Dickondoes and they'd know he was friends for sure.""""I shouldn't mind Dickon looking at me,"" said Colin; ""I want to seehim.""""I'm glad you said that,"" answered Mary, ""because—because—""Quite suddenly it came into her mind that this was the minute to tellhim. Colin knew something new was coming.""Because what?"" he cried eagerly.Mary was so anxious that she got up from her stool and came to him andcaught hold of both his hands.""Can I trust you? I trusted Dickon because birds trusted him. Can Itrust you—for sure—for sure?"" she implored.Her face was so solemn that he almost whispered his answer.""Yes—yes!""""Well, Dickon will come to see you to-morrow morning, and he'll bringhis creatures with him.""""Oh! Oh!"" Colin cried out in delight.""But that's not all,"" Mary went on, almost pale with solemn excitement.""The rest is better. There is a door into the garden. I found it. It isunder the ivy on the wall.""If he had been a strong healthy boy Colin would probably have shouted""Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!"" but he was weak and rather hysterical; hiseyes grew bigger and bigger and he gasped for breath.""Oh! Mary!"" he cried out with a half sob. ""Shall I see it? Shall I getinto it? Shall I live to get into it?"" and he clutched her hands anddragged her toward him.""Of course you'll see it!"" snapped Mary indignantly. ""Of course you'lllive to get into it! Don't be silly!""And she was so un-hysterical and natural and childish that she broughthim to his senses and he began to laugh at himself and a few minutesafterward she was sitting on her stool again telling him not what sheimagined the secret garden to be like but what it really was, andColin's aches and tiredness were forgotten and he was listeningenraptured.""It is just what you thought it would be,"" he said at last. ""It soundsjust as if you had really seen it. You know I said that when you told mefirst.""Mary hesitated about two minutes and then boldly spoke the truth.""I had seen it—and I had been in,"" she said. ""I found the key and gotin weeks ago. But I daren't tell you—I daren't because I was so afraidI couldn't trust you—for sure!"""

He was always sent for at once when such a thing occurredand he always found, when he arrived, a white shaken boy lying on hisbed, sulky and still so hysterical that he was ready to break into freshsobbing at the least word. In fact, Dr. Craven dreaded and detested thedifficulties of these visits. On this occasion he was away fromMisselthwaite Manor until afternoon.""How is he?"" he asked Mrs. Medlock rather irritably when he arrived. ""Hewill break a blood-vessel in one of those fits some day. The boy is halfinsane with hysteria and self-indulgence.""""Well, sir,"" answered Mrs. Medlock, ""you'll scarcely believe your eyeswhen you see him. That plain sour-faced child that's almost as bad ashimself has just bewitched him. How she's done it there's no telling.The Lord knows she's nothing to look at and you scarcely ever hear herspeak, but she did what none of us dare do. She just flew at him like alittle cat last night, and stamped her feet and ordered him to stopscreaming, and somehow she startled him so that he actually did stop,and this afternoon—well just come up and see, sir. It's pastcrediting.""The scene which Dr. Craven beheld when he entered his patient's room wasindeed rather astonishing to him. As Mrs. Medlock opened the door heheard laughing and chattering. Colin was on his sofa in hisdressing-gown and he was sitting up quite straight looking at a picturein one of the garden books and talking to the plain child who at thatmoment could scarcely be called plain at all because her face was soglowing with enjoyment.""Those long spires of blue ones—we'll have a lot of those,"" Colin wasannouncing. ""They're called Del-phin-iums.""""Dickon says they're larkspurs made big and grand,"" cried Mistress Mary.""There are clumps there already.""Then they saw Dr. Craven and stopped. Mary became quite still and Colinlooked fretful.""I am sorry to hear you were ill last night, my boy,"" Dr. Craven said atrifle nervously. He was rather a nervous man.""I'm better now—much better,"" Colin answered, rather like a Rajah.""I'm going out in my chair in a day or two if it is fine. I want somefresh air.""Dr. Craven sat down by him and felt his pulse and looked at himcuriously.""It must be a very fine day,"" he said, ""and you must be very careful notto tire yourself.""""Fresh air won't tire me,"" said the young Rajah.As there had been occasions when this same young gentleman had shriekedaloud with rage and had insisted that fresh air would give him cold andkill him, it is not to be wondered at that his doctor felt somewhatstartled.""I thought you did not like fresh air,"" he said.""I don't when I am by myself,"" replied the Rajah; ""but my cousin isgoing out with me.""""And the nurse, of course?"" suggested Dr. Craven.""No, I will not have the nurse,"" so magnificently that Mary could nothelp remembering how the young native Prince had looked with hisdiamonds and emeralds and pearls stuck all over him and the great rubieson the small dark hand he had waved to command his servants to approachwith salaams and receive his orders.""My cousin knows how to take care of me. I am always better when she iswith me. She made me better last night. A very strong boy I know willpush my carriage.""Dr. Craven felt rather alarmed. If this tiresome hysterical boy shouldchance to get well he himself would lose all chance of inheritingMisselthwaite; but he was not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weakone, and he did not intend to let him run into actual danger.""He must be a strong boy and a steady boy,"" he said. ""And I must knowsomething about him. Who is he? What is his name?""""It's Dickon,"" Mary spoke up suddenly. She felt somehow that everybodywho knew the moor must know Dickon. And she was right, too. She saw thatin a moment Dr. Craven's serious face relaxed into a relieved smile.""Oh, Dickon,"" he said. ""If it is Dickon you will be safe enough. He's asstrong as a moor pony, is Dickon.""""And he's trusty,"" said Mary. ""He's th' trustiest lad i' Yorkshire."" Shehad been talking Yorkshire to Colin and she forgot herself.""Did Dickon teach you that?"" asked Dr. Craven, laughing outright.""I'm learning it as if it was French,"" said Mary rather coldly. ""It'slike a native dialect in India. Very clever people try to learn them. Ilike it and so does Colin.""""Well, well,"" he said. ""If it amuses you perhaps it won't do you anyharm. Did you take your bromide last night, Colin?""""No,"" Colin answered. ""I wouldn't take it at first and after Mary mademe quiet she talked me to sleep—in a low voice—about the springcreeping into a garden.""""That sounds soothing,"" said Dr. Craven, more perplexed than ever andglancing sideways at Mistress Mary sitting on her stool and looking downsilently at the carpet. ""You are evidently better, but you mustremember—""""I don't want to remember,"" interrupted the Rajah, appearing again.""When I lie by myself and remember I begin to have pains everywhere andI think of things that make me begin to scream because I hate them so.If there was a doctor anywhere who could make you forget you were illinstead of remembering it I would have him brought here."" And he waved athin hand which ought really to have been covered with royal signetrings made of rubies. ""It is because my cousin makes me forget that shemakes me better.""Dr. Craven had never made such a short stay after a ""tantrum""; usuallyhe was obliged to remain a very long time and do a great many things.This afternoon he did not give any medicine or leave any new orders andhe was spared any disagreeable scenes. When he went down-stairs helooked very thoughtful and when he talked to Mrs. Medlock in the libraryshe felt that he was a much puzzled man.""Well, sir,"" she ventured, ""could you have believed it?""""It is certainly a new state of affairs,"" said the doctor. ""And there'sno denying it is better than the old one.""""I believe Susan Sowerby's right—I do that,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""Istopped in her cottage on my way to Thwaite yesterday and had a bit oftalk with her. And she says to me, 'Well, Sarah Ann, she mayn't be agood child, an' she mayn't be a pretty one, but she's a child, an'children needs children.' We went to school together, Susan Sowerby andme.""""She's the best sick nurse I know,"" said Dr. Craven. ""When I find her ina cottage I know the chances are that I shall save my patient.""Mrs. Medlock smiled. She was fond of Susan Sowerby.""She's got a way with her, has Susan,"" she went on quite volubly. ""I'vebeen thinking all morning of one thing she said yesterday. She says,'Once when I was givin' th' children a bit of a preach after they'd beenfightin' I ses to 'em all, ""When I was at school my jography told asth' world was shaped like a orange an' I found out before I was tenthat th' whole orange doesn't belong to nobody. No one owns more thanhis bit of a quarter an' there's times it seems like there's not enowquarters to go round. But don't you—none o' you—think as you own th'whole orange or you'll find out you're mistaken, an' you won't find itout without hard knocks."" What children learns from children,' she says,'is that there's no sense in grabbin' at th' whole orange—peel an' all.If you do you'll likely not get even th' pips, an' them's too bitter toeat.'""""She's a shrewd woman,"" said Dr. Craven, putting on his coat.""Well, she's got a way of saying things,"" ended Mrs. Medlock, muchpleased. ""Sometimes I've said to her, 'Eh! Susan, if you was a differentwoman an' didn't talk such broad Yorkshire I've seen the times when Ishould have said you was clever.'""That night Colin slept without once awakening and when he opened hiseyes in the morning he lay still and smiled without knowing it—smiledbecause he felt so curiously comfortable. It was actually nice to beawake, and he turned over and stretched his limbs luxuriously. He feltas if tight strings which had held him had loosened themselves and lethim go. He did not know that Dr. Craven would have said that his nerveshad relaxed and rested themselves. Instead of lying and staring at thewall and wishing he had not awakened, his mind was full of the plans heand Mary had made yesterday, of pictures of the garden and of Dickon andhis wild creatures. It was so nice to have things to think about. And hehad not been awake more than ten minutes when he heard feet runningalong the corridor and Mary was at the door. The next minute she was inthe room and had run across to his bed, bringing with her a waft offresh air full of the scent of the morning.""You've been out! You've been out! There's that nice smell of leaves!""he cried.She had been running and her hair was loose and blown and she was brightwith the air and pink-cheeked, though he could not see it.""It's so beautiful!"" she said, a little breathless with her speed. ""Younever saw anything so beautiful! It has come! I thought it had comethat other morning, but it was only coming. It is here now! It has come,the Spring! Dickon says so!""""Has it?"" cried Colin, and though he really knew nothing about it hefelt his heart beat. He actually sat up in bed.""Open the window!"" he added, laughing half with joyful excitement andhalf at his own fancy. ""Perhaps we may hear golden trumpets!""And though he laughed, Mary was at the window in a moment and in amoment more it was opened wide and freshness and softness and scents andbirds' songs were pouring through.""That's fresh air,"" she said. ""Lie on your back and draw in long breathsof it. That's what Dickon does when he's lying on the moor. He says hefeels it in his veins and it makes him strong and he feels as if hecould live forever and ever. Breathe it and breathe it.""She was only repeating what Dickon had told her, but she caught Colin'sfancy.""'Forever and ever'! Does it make him feel like that?"" he said, and hedid as she told him, drawing in long deep breaths over and over againuntil he felt that something quite new and delightful was happening tohim.Mary was at his bedside again.""Things are crowding up out of the earth,"" she ran on in a hurry. ""Andthere are flowers uncurling and buds on everything and the green veilhas covered nearly all the gray and the birds are in such a hurry abouttheir nests for fear they may be too late that some of them are evenfighting for places in the secret garden. And the rose-bushes look aswick as wick can be, and there are primroses in the lanes and woods, andthe seeds we planted are up, and Dickon has brought the fox and the crowand the squirrels and a new-born lamb.""And then she paused for breath. The new-born lamb Dickon had found threedays before lying by its dead mother among the gorse bushes on the moor.It was not the first motherless lamb he had found and he knew what to dowith it. He had taken it to the cottage wrapped in his jacket and he hadlet it lie near the fire and had fed it with warm milk. It was a softthing with a darling silly baby face and legs rather long for its body.Dickon had carried it over the moor in his arms and its feeding bottlewas in his pocket with a squirrel, and when Mary had sat under a treewith its limp warmness huddled on her lap she had felt as if she weretoo full of strange joy to speak. A lamb—a lamb! A living lamb who layon your lap like a baby!She was describing it with great joy and Colin was listening and drawingin long breaths of air when the nurse entered. She started a little atthe sight of the open window. She had sat stifling in the room many awarm day because her patient was sure that open windows gave peoplecold.""Are you sure you are not chilly, Master Colin?"" she inquired.""No,"" was the answer. ""I am breathing long breaths of fresh air. Itmakes you strong. I am going to get up to the sofa for breakfast and mycousin will have breakfast with me.""The nurse went away, concealing a smile, to give the order for twobreakfasts. She found the servants' hall a more amusing place than theinvalid's chamber and just now everybody wanted to hear the news fromup-stairs. There was a great deal of joking about the unpopular youngrecluse who, as the cook said, ""had found his master, and good for him.""The servants' hall had been very tired of the tantrums, and the butler,who was a man with a family, had more than once expressed his opinionthat the invalid would be all the better ""for a good hiding.""When Colin was on his sofa and the breakfast for two was put upon thetable he made an announcement to the nurse in his most Rajah-likemanner.""A boy, and a fox, and a crow, and two squirrels, and a new-born lamb,are coming to see me this morning. I want them brought up-stairs as soonas they come,"" he said. ""You are not to begin playing with the animalsin the servants' hall and keep them there. I want them here.""The nurse gave a slight gasp and tried to conceal it with a cough.""Yes, sir,"" she answered.""I'll tell you what you can do,"" added Colin, waving his hand. ""You cantell Martha to bring them here. The boy is Martha's brother. His name isDickon and he is an animal charmer.""""I hope the animals won't bite, Master Colin,"" said the nurse.""I told you he was a charmer,"" said Colin austerely. ""Charmers' animalsnever bite.""""There are snake-charmers in India,"" said Mary; ""and they can put theirsnakes' heads in their mouths.""""Goodness!"" shuddered the nurse.They ate their breakfast with the morning air pouring in upon them.Colin's breakfast was a very good one and Mary watched him with seriousinterest.""You will begin to get fatter just as I did,"" she said. ""I never wantedmy breakfast when I was in India and now I always want it.""""I wanted mine this morning,"" said Colin. ""Perhaps it was the fresh air.When do you think Dickon will come?""He was not long in coming. In about ten minutes Mary held up her hand.""Listen!"" she said. ""Did you hear a caw?""Colin listened and heard it, the oddest sound in the world to hearinside a house, a hoarse ""caw-caw.""""Yes,"" he answered.""That's Soot,"" said Mary. ""Listen again! Do you hear a bleat—a tinyone?""""Oh, yes!"" cried Colin, quite flushing.""That's the new-born lamb,"" said Mary. ""He's coming.""Dickon's moorland boots were thick and clumsy and though he tried towalk quietly they made a clumping sound as he walked through the longcorridors. Mary and Colin heard him marching—marching, until he passedthrough the tapestry door on to the soft carpet of Colin's own passage.""If you please, sir,"" announced Martha, opening the door, ""if youplease, sir, here's Dickon an' his creatures.""Dickon came in smiling his nicest wide smile. The new-born lamb was inhis arms and the little red fox trotted by his side. Nut sat on his leftshoulder and Soot on his right and Shell's head and paws peeped out ofhis coat pocket.Colin slowly sat up and stared and stared—as he had stared when hefirst saw Mary; but this was a stare of wonder and delight. The truthwas that in spite of all he had heard he had not in the least understoodwhat this boy would be like and that his fox and his crow and hissquirrels and his lamb were so near to him and his friendliness thatthey seemed almost to be part of himself. Colin had never talked to aboy in his life and he was so overwhelmed by his own pleasure andcuriosity that he did not even think of speaking.But Dickon did not feel the least shy or awkward. He had not feltembarrassed because the crow had not known his language and had onlystared and had not spoken to him the first time they met. Creatures werealways like that until they found out about you. He walked over toColin's sofa and put the new-born lamb quietly on his lap, andimmediately the little creature turned to the warm velvet dressing-gownand began to nuzzle and nuzzle into its folds and butt its tight-curledhead with soft impatience against his side. Of course no boy could havehelped speaking then.""What is it doing?"" cried Colin. ""What does it want?""""It wants its mother,"" said Dickon, smiling more and more. ""I brought itto thee a bit hungry because I knowed tha'd like to see it feed.""He knelt down by the sofa and took a feeding-bottle from his pocket.""Come on, little 'un,"" he said, turning the small woolly white head witha gentle brown hand. ""This is what tha's after. Tha'll get more out o'this than tha' will out o' silk velvet coats. There now,"" and he pushedthe rubber tip of the bottle into the nuzzling mouth and the lamb beganto suck it with ravenous ecstasy.After that there was no wondering what to say. By the time the lamb fellasleep questions poured forth and Dickon answered them all. He told themhow he had found the lamb just as the sun was rising three mornings ago.He had been standing on the moor listening to a skylark and watching himswing higher and higher into the sky until he was only a speck in theheights of blue.""I'd almost lost him but for his song an' I was wonderin' how a chapcould hear it when it seemed as if he'd get out o' th' world in aminute—an' just then I heard somethin' else far off among th' gorsebushes. It was a weak bleatin' an' I knowed it was a new lamb as washungry an' I knowed it wouldn't be hungry if it hadn't lost its mothersomehow, so I set off searchin'. Eh! I did have a look for it. I went inan' out among th' gorse bushes an' round an' round an' I always seemedto take th' wrong turnin'. But at last I seed a bit o' white by a rockon top o' th' moor an' I climbed up an' found th' little 'un half deadwi' cold an' clemmin'.""While he talked, Soot flew solemnly in and out of the open window andcawed remarks about the scenery while Nut and Shell made excursions intothe big trees outside and ran up and down trunks and explored branches.Captain curled up near Dickon, who sat on the hearth-rug frompreference.They looked at the pictures in the gardening books and Dickon knew allthe flowers by their country names and knew exactly which ones werealready growing in the secret garden.""I couldna' say that there name,"" he said, pointing to one under whichwas written ""Aquilegia,"" ""but us calls that a columbine, an' that thereone it's a snapdragon and they both grow wild in hedges, but these isgarden ones an' they're bigger an' grander. There's some big clumps o'columbine in th' garden. They'll look like a bed o' blue an' whitebutterflies flutterin' when they're out.""""I'm going to see them,"" cried Colin. ""I am going to see them!""""Aye, that tha' mun,"" said Mary quite seriously. ""An tha' munnot lose notime about it."""

The things he had to tell about otters'and badgers' and water-rats' houses, not to mention birds' nests andfield-mice and their burrows, were enough to make you almost tremblewith excitement when you heard all the intimate details from an animalcharmer and realized with what thrilling eagerness and anxiety the wholebusy underworld was working.""They're same as us,"" said Dickon, ""only they have to build their homesevery year. An' it keeps 'em so busy they fair scuffle to get 'emdone.""The most absorbing thing, however, was the preparations to be madebefore Colin could be transported with sufficient secrecy to the garden.No one must see the chair-carriage and Dickon and Mary after they turneda certain corner of the shrubbery and entered upon the walk outside theivied walls. As each day passed, Colin had become more and more fixed inhis feeling that the mystery surrounding the garden was one of itsgreatest charms. Nothing must spoil that. No one must ever suspect thatthey had a secret. People must think that he was simply going out withMary and Dickon because he liked them and did not object to theirlooking at him. They had long and quite delightful talks about theirroute. They would go up this path and down that one and cross the otherand go round among the fountain flower-beds as if they were looking atthe ""bedding-out plants"" the head gardener, Mr. Roach, had been havingarranged. That would seem such a rational thing to do that no one wouldthink it at all mysterious. They would turn into the shrubbery walks andlose themselves until they came to the long walls. It was almost asserious and elaborately thought out as the plans of march made by greatgenerals in time of war.Rumors of the new and curious things which were occurring in theinvalid's apartments had of course filtered through the servants' hallinto the stable yards and out among the gardeners, but notwithstandingthis, Mr. Roach was startled one day when he received orders from MasterColin's room to the effect that he must report himself in the apartmentno outsider had ever seen, as the invalid himself desired to speak tohim.""Well, well,"" he said to himself as he hurriedly changed his coat,""what's to do now? His Royal Highness that wasn't to be looked atcalling up a man he's never set eyes on.""Mr. Roach was not without curiosity. He had never caught even a glimpseof the boy and had heard a dozen exaggerated stories about his uncannylooks and ways and his insane tempers. The thing he had heard oftenestwas that he might die at any moment and there had been numerous fancifuldescriptions of a humped back and helpless limbs, given by people whohad never seen him.""Things are changing in this house, Mr. Roach,"" said Mrs. Medlock, asshe led him up the back staircase to the corridor on to which opened thehitherto mysterious chamber.""Let's hope they're changing for the better, Mrs. Medlock,"" heanswered.""They couldn't well change for the worse,"" she continued; ""and queer asit all is there's them as finds their duties made a lot easier to standup under. Don't you be surprised, Mr. Roach, if you find yourself in themiddle of a menagerie and Martha Sowerby's Dickon more at home than youor me could ever be.""There really was a sort of Magic about Dickon, as Mary always privatelybelieved. When Mr. Roach heard his name he smiled quite leniently.""He'd be at home in Buckingham Palace or at the bottom of a coal mine,""he said. ""And yet it's not impudence, either. He's just fine, is thatlad.""It was perhaps well he had been prepared or he might have been startled.When the bedroom door was opened a large crow, which seemed quite athome perched on the high back of a carven chair, announced the entranceof a visitor by saying ""Caw—Caw"" quite loudly. In spite of Mrs.Medlock's warning, Mr. Roach only just escaped being sufficientlyundignified to jump backward.The young Rajah was neither in bed nor on his sofa. He was sitting in anarmchair and a young lamb was standing by him shaking its tail infeeding-lamb fashion as Dickon knelt giving it milk from its bottle. Asquirrel was perched on Dickon's bent back attentively nibbling a nut.The little girl from India was sitting on a big footstool looking on.""Here is Mr. Roach, Master Colin,"" said Mrs. Medlock.The young Rajah turned and looked his servitor over—at least that waswhat the head gardener felt happened.""Oh, you are Roach, are you?"" he said. ""I sent for you to give you somevery important orders.""""Very good, sir,"" answered Roach, wondering if he was to receiveinstructions to fell all the oaks in the park or to transform theorchards into water-gardens.""I am going out in my chair this afternoon,"" said Colin. ""If the freshair agrees with me I may go out every day. When I go, none of thegardeners are to be anywhere near the Long Walk by the garden walls. Noone is to be there. I shall go out about two o'clock and every one mustkeep away until I send word that they may go back to their work.""""Very good, sir,"" replied Mr. Roach, much relieved to hear that the oaksmight remain and that the orchards were safe.""Mary,"" said Colin, turning to her, ""what is that thing you say in Indiawhen you have finished talking and want people to go?""""You say, 'You have my permission to go,'"" answered Mary.The Rajah waved his hand.""You have my permission to go, Roach,"" he said. ""But, remember, this isvery important.""""Caw—Caw!"" remarked the crow hoarsely but not impolitely.""Very good, sir. Thank you, sir,"" said Mr. Roach, and Mrs. Medlock tookhim out of the room.Outside in the corridor, being a rather good-natured man, he smileduntil he almost laughed.""My word!"" he said, ""he's got a fine lordly way with him, hasn't he?You'd think he was a whole Royal Family rolled into one—Prince Consortand all.""""Eh!"" protested Mrs. Medlock, ""we've had to let him trample all overevery one of us ever since he had feet and he thinks that's what folkswas born for.""""Perhaps he'll grow out of it, if he lives,"" suggested Mr. Roach.""Well, there's one thing pretty sure,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""If he doeslive and that Indian child stays here I'll warrant she teaches him thatthe whole orange does not belong to him, as Susan Sowerby says. Andhe'll be likely to find out the size of his own quarter.""Inside the room Colin was leaning back on his cushions.""It's all safe now,"" he said. ""And this afternoon I shall see it—thisafternoon I shall be in it!""Dickon went back to the garden with his creatures and Mary stayed withColin. She did not think he looked tired but he was very quiet beforetheir lunch came and he was quiet while they were eating it. Shewondered why and asked him about it.""What big eyes you've got, Colin,"" she said. ""When you are thinking theyget as big as saucers. What are you thinking about now?""""I can't help thinking about what it will look like,"" he answered.""The garden?"" asked Mary.""The springtime,"" he said. ""I was thinking that I've really never seenit before. I scarcely ever went out and when I did go I never looked atit. I didn't even think about it.""""I never saw it in India because there wasn't any,"" said Mary.Shut in and morbid as his life had been, Colin had more imagination thanshe had and at least he had spent a good deal of time looking atwonderful books and pictures.""That morning when you ran in and said 'It's come! It's come!' you mademe feel quite queer. It sounded as if things were coming with a greatprocession and big bursts and wafts of music. I've a picture like it inone of my books—crowds of lovely people and children with garlands andbranches with blossoms on them, every one laughing and dancing andcrowding and playing on pipes. That was why I said, 'Perhaps we shallhear golden trumpets' and told you to throw open the window.""""How funny!"" said Mary. ""That's really just what it feels like. And ifall the flowers and leaves and green things and birds and wild creaturesdanced past at once, what a crowd it would be! I'm sure they'd dance andsing and flute and that would be the wafts of music.""They both laughed but it was not because the idea was laughable butbecause they both so liked it.A little later the nurse made Colin ready. She noticed that instead oflying like a log while his clothes were put on he sat up and made someefforts to help himself, and he talked and laughed with Mary all thetime.""This is one of his good days, sir,"" she said to Dr. Craven, whodropped in to inspect him. ""He's in such good spirits that it makes himstronger.""""I'll call in again later in the afternoon, after he has come in,"" saidDr. Craven. ""I must see how the going out agrees with him. I wish,"" in avery low voice, ""that he would let you go with him.""""I'd rather give up the case this moment, sir, than even stay here whileit's suggested,"" answered the nurse with sudden firmness.""I hadn't really decided to suggest it,"" said the doctor, with hisslight nervousness. ""We'll try the experiment. Dickon's a lad I'd trustwith a new-born child.""The strongest footman in the house carried Colin down-stairs and put himin his wheeled chair near which Dickon waited outside. After themanservant had arranged his rugs and cushions the Rajah waved his handto him and to the nurse.""You have my permission to go,"" he said, and they both disappearedquickly and it must be confessed giggled when they were safely insidethe house.Dickon began to push the wheeled chair slowly and steadily. MistressMary walked beside it and Colin leaned back and lifted his face to thesky. The arch of it looked very high and the small snowy clouds seemedlike white birds floating on outspread wings below its crystal blueness.The wind swept in soft big breaths down from the moor and was strangewith a wild clear scented sweetness. Colin kept lifting his thin chestto draw it in, and his big eyes looked as if it were they which werelistening—listening, instead of his ears.""There are so many sounds of singing and humming and calling out,"" hesaid. ""What is that scent the puffs of wind bring?""""It's gorse on th' moor that's openin' out,"" answered Dickon. ""Eh! th'bees are at it wonderful to-day.""Not a human creature was to be caught sight of in the paths they took.In fact every gardener or gardener's lad had been witched away. But theywound in and out among the shrubbery and out and round the fountainbeds, following their carefully planned route for the mere mysteriouspleasure of it. But when at last they turned into the Long Walk by theivied walls the excited sense of an approaching thrill made them, forsome curious reason they could not have explained, begin to speak inwhispers.""This is it,"" breathed Mary. ""This is where I used to walk up and downand wonder and wonder.""""Is it?"" cried Colin, and his eyes began to search the ivy with eagercuriousness. ""But I can see nothing,"" he whispered. ""There is no door.""""That's what I thought,"" said Mary.Then there was a lovely breathless silence and the chair wheeled on.""That is the garden where Ben Weatherstaff works,"" said Mary.""Is it?"" said Colin.A few yards more and Mary whispered again.""This is where the robin flew over the wall,"" she said.""Is it?"" cried Colin. ""Oh! I wish he'd come again!""""And that,"" said Mary with solemn delight, pointing under a big lilacbush, ""is where he perched on the little heap of earth and showed me thekey.""Then Colin sat up.""Where? Where? There?"" he cried, and his eyes were as big as the wolf'sin Red Riding-Hood, when Red Riding-Hood felt called upon to remark onthem. Dickon stood still and the wheeled chair stopped.""And this,"" said Mary, stepping on to the bed close to the ivy, ""iswhere I went to talk to him when he chirped at me from the top of thewall. And this is the ivy the wind blew back,"" and she took hold of thehanging green curtain.""Oh! is it—is it!"" gasped Colin.""And here is the handle, and here is the door. Dickon push him in—pushhim in quickly!""And Dickon did it with one strong, steady, splendid push.But Colin had actually dropped back against his cushions, even though hegasped with delight, and he had covered his eyes with his hands and heldthem there shutting out everything until they were inside and the chairstopped as if by magic and the door was closed. Not till then did hetake them away and look round and round and round as Dickon and Mary haddone. And over walls and earth and trees and swinging sprays andtendrils the fair green veil of tender little leaves had crept, and inthe grass under the trees and the gray urns in the alcoves and here andthere everywhere were touches or splashes of gold and purple and whiteand the trees were showing pink and snow above his head and there werefluttering of wings and faint sweet pipes and humming and scents andscents. And the sun fell warm upon his face like a hand with a lovelytouch. And in wonder Mary and Dickon stood and stared at him. He lookedso strange and different because a pink glow of color had actuallycrept all over him—ivory face and neck and hands and all.""I shall get well! I shall get well!"" he cried out. ""Mary! Dickon! Ishall get well! And I shall live forever and ever and ever!"""

One knows it sometimes when one gets up at the tender solemndawn-time and goes out and stands alone and throws one's head far backand looks up and up and watches the pale sky slowly changing andflushing and marvelous unknown things happening until the East almostmakes one cry out and one's heart stands still at the strange unchangingmajesty of the rising of the sun—which has been happening every morningfor thousands and thousands and thousands of years. One knows it thenfor a moment or so. And one knows it sometimes when one stands byoneself in a wood at sunset and the mysterious deep gold stillnessslanting through and under the branches seems to be saying slowly againand again something one cannot quite hear, however much one tries. Thensometimes the immense quiet of the dark blue at night with millions ofstars waiting and watching makes one sure; and sometimes a sound offar-off music makes it true; and sometimes a look in some one's eyes.And it was like that with Colin when he first saw and heard and felt theSpringtime inside the four high walls of a hidden garden. That afternoonthe whole world seemed to devote itself to being perfect and radiantlybeautiful and kind to one boy. Perhaps out of pure heavenly goodness thespring came and crowded everything it possibly could into that oneplace. More than once Dickon paused in what he was doing and stood stillwith a sort of growing wonder in his eyes, shaking his head softly.""Eh! it is graidely,"" he said. ""I'm twelve goin' on thirteen an' there'sa lot o' afternoons in thirteen years, but seems to me like I never seedone as graidely as this 'ere.""""Aye, it is a graidely one,"" said Mary, and she sighed for mere joy.""I'll warrant it's th' graidelest one as ever was in this world.""""Does tha' think,"" said Colin with dreamy carefulness, ""as happen it wasmade loike this 'ere all o' purpose for me?""""My word!"" cried Mary admiringly, ""that there is a bit o' goodYorkshire. Tha'rt shapin' first-rate—that tha' art.""And delight reigned.They drew the chair under the plum-tree, which was snow-white withblossoms and musical with bees. It was like a king's canopy, a fairyking's. There were flowering cherry-trees near and apple-trees whosebuds were pink and white, and here and there one had burst open wide.Between the blossoming branches of the canopy bits of blue sky lookeddown like wonderful eyes.Mary and Dickon worked a little here and there and Colin watched them.They brought him things to look at—buds which were opening, buds whichwere tight closed, bits of twig whose leaves were just showing green,the feather of a woodpecker which had dropped on the grass, the emptyshell of some bird early hatched. Dickon pushed the chair slowly roundand round the garden, stopping every other moment to let him look atwonders springing out of the earth or trailing down from trees. It waslike being taken in state round the country of a magic king and queenand shown all the mysterious riches it contained.""I wonder if we shall see the robin?"" said Colin.""Tha'll see him often enow after a bit,"" answered Dickon. ""When th' eggshatches out th' little chap he'll be kep' so busy it'll make his headswim. Tha'll see him flyin' backward an' for'ard carryin' worms nigh asbig as himsel' an' that much noise goin' on in th' nest when he getsthere as fair flusters him so as he scarce knows which big mouth to dropth' first piece in. An' gapin' beaks an' squawks on every side. Mothersays as when she sees th' work a robin has to keep them gapin' beaksfilled, she feels like she was a lady with nothin' to do. She says she'sseen th' little chaps when it seemed like th' sweat must be droppin' off'em, though folk can't see it.""This made them giggle so delightedly that they were obliged to covertheir mouths with their hands, remembering that they must not be heard.Colin had been instructed as to the law of whispers and low voicesseveral days before. He liked the mysteriousness of it and did his best,but in the midst of excited enjoyment it is rather difficult never tolaugh above a whisper.Every moment of the afternoon was full of new things and every hour thesunshine grew more golden. The wheeled chair had been drawn back underthe canopy and Dickon had sat down on the grass and had just drawn outhis pipe when Colin saw something he had not had time to notice before.""That's a very old tree over there, isn't it?"" he said.Dickon looked across the grass at the tree and Mary looked and there wasa brief moment of stillness.""Yes,"" answered Dickon, after it, and his low voice had a very gentlesound.Mary gazed at the tree and thought.""The branches are quite gray and there's not a single leaf anywhere,""Colin went on. ""It's quite dead, isn't it?""""Aye,"" admitted Dickon. ""But them roses as has climbed all over it willnear hide every bit o' th' dead wood when they're full o' leaves an'flowers. It won't look dead then. It'll be th' prettiest of all.""Mary still gazed at the tree and thought.""It looks as if a big branch had been broken off,"" said Colin. ""I wonderhow it was done.""""It's been done many a year,"" answered Dickon. ""Eh!"" with a suddenrelieved start and laying his hand on Colin. ""Look at that robin! Therehe is! He's been foragin' for his mate.""Colin was almost too late but he just caught sight of him, the flash ofred-breasted bird with something in his beak. He darted through thegreenness and into the close-grown corner and was out of sight. Colinleaned back on his cushion again, laughing a little.""He's taking her tea to her. Perhaps it's five o'clock. I think I'd likesome tea myself.""And so they were safe.""It was Magic which sent the robin,"" said Mary secretly to Dickonafterward. ""I know it was Magic."" For both she and Dickon had beenafraid Colin might ask something about the tree whose branch had brokenoff ten years ago and they had talked it over together and Dickon hadstood and rubbed his head in a troubled way.""We mun look as if it wasn't no different from th' other trees,"" he hadsaid. ""We couldn't never tell him how it broke, poor lad. If he saysanything about it we mun—we mun try to look cheerful.""""Aye, that we mun,"" had answered Mary.But she had not felt as if she looked cheerful when she gazed at thetree. She wondered and wondered in those few moments if there was anyreality in that other thing Dickon had said. He had gone on rubbing hisrust-red hair in a puzzled way, but a nice comforted look had begun togrow in his blue eyes.""Mrs. Craven was a very lovely young lady,"" he had gone on ratherhesitatingly. ""An' mother she thinks maybe she's about Misselthwaitemany a time lookin' after Mester Colin, same as all mothers do whenthey're took out o' th' world. They have to come back, tha' sees. Happenshe's been in the garden an' happen it was her set us to work, an' toldus to bring him here.""Mary had thought he meant something about Magic. She was a greatbeliever in Magic. Secretly she quite believed that Dickon worked Magic,of course good Magic, on everything near him and that was why peopleliked him so much and wild creatures knew he was their friend. Shewondered, indeed, if it were not possible that his gift had brought therobin just at the right moment when Colin asked that dangerous question.She felt that his Magic was working all the afternoon and making Colinlook like an entirely different boy. It did not seem possible that hecould be the crazy creature who had screamed and beaten and bitten hispillow. Even his ivory whiteness seemed to change. The faint glow ofcolor which had shown on his face and neck and hands when he first gotinside the garden really never quite died away. He looked as if he weremade of flesh instead of ivory or wax.They saw the robin carry food to his mate two or three times, and it wasso suggestive of afternoon tea that Colin felt they must have some.""Go and make one of the men servants bring some in a basket to therhododendron walk,"" he said. ""And then you and Dickon can bring ithere.""It was an agreeable idea, easily carried out, and when the white clothwas spread upon the grass, with hot tea and buttered toast and crumpets,a delightfully hungry meal was eaten, and several birds on domesticerrands paused to inquire what was going on and were led intoinvestigating crumbs with great activity. Nut and Shell whisked up treeswith pieces of cake and Soot took the entire half of a buttered crumpetinto a corner and pecked at and examined and turned it over and madehoarse remarks about it until he decided to swallow it all joyfully inone gulp.The afternoon was dragging toward its mellow hour. The sun was deepeningthe gold of its lances, the bees were going home and the birds wereflying past less often. Dickon and Mary were sitting on the grass, thetea-basket was re-packed ready to be taken back to the house, and Colinwas lying against his cushions with his heavy locks pushed back from hisforehead and his face looking quite a natural color.""I don't want this afternoon to go,"" he said; ""but I shall come backto-morrow, and the day after, and the day after, and the day after.""""You'll get plenty of fresh air, won't you?"" said Mary.""I'm going to get nothing else,"" he answered. ""I've seen the spring nowand I'm going to see the summer. I'm going to see everything grow here.I'm going to grow here myself.""""That tha' will,"" said Dickon. ""Us'll have thee walkin' about here an'diggin' same as other folk afore long.""Colin flushed tremendously.""Walk!"" he said. ""Dig! Shall I?""Dickon's glance at him was delicately cautious. Neither he nor Mary hadever asked if anything was the matter with his legs.""For sure tha' will,"" he said stoutly. ""Tha'—tha's got legs o' thineown, same as other folks!""Mary was rather frightened until she heard Colin's answer.""Nothing really ails them,"" he said, ""but they are so thin and weak.They shake so that I'm afraid to try to stand on them.""Both Mary and Dickon drew a relieved breath.""When tha' stops bein' afraid tha'lt stand on 'em,"" Dickon said withrenewed cheer. ""An' tha'lt stop bein' afraid in a bit.""""I shall?"" said Colin, and he lay still as if he were wondering aboutthings.They were really very quiet for a little while. The sun was droppinglower. It was that hour when everything stills itself, and they reallyhad had a busy and exciting afternoon. Colin looked as if he wereresting luxuriously. Even the creatures had ceased moving about and haddrawn together and were resting near them. Soot had perched on a lowbranch and drawn up one leg and dropped the gray film drowsily over hiseyes. Mary privately thought he looked as if he might snore in a minute.In the midst of this stillness it was rather startling when Colin halflifted his head and exclaimed in a loud suddenly alarmed whisper:""Who is that man?""Dickon and Mary scrambled to their feet.""Man!"" they both cried in low quick voices.Colin pointed to the high wall.""Look!"" he whispered excitedly. ""Just look!""Mary and Dickon wheeled about and looked. There was Ben Weatherstaff'sindignant face glaring at them over the wall from the top of a ladder!He actually shook his fist at Mary.""If I wasn't a bachelder, an' tha' was a wench o' mine,"" he cried, ""I'dgive thee a hidin'!""He mounted another step threateningly as if it were his energeticintention to jump down and deal with her; but as she came toward him heevidently thought better of it and stood on the top step of his laddershaking his fist down at her.""I never thowt much o' thee!"" he harangued. ""I couldna' abide thee th'first time I set eyes on thee. A scrawny buttermilk-faced young besom,allus askin' questions an' pokin' tha' nose where it wasna' wanted. Inever knowed how tha' got so thick wi' me. If it hadna' been for th'robin—Drat him—""""Ben Weatherstaff,"" called out Mary, finding her breath. She stood belowhim and called up to him with a sort of gasp. ""Ben Weatherstaff, it wasthe robin who showed me the way!""Then it did seem as if Ben really would scramble down on her side of thewall, he was so outraged.""Tha' young bad 'un!"" he called down at her. ""Layin' tha' badness on arobin,—not but what he's impidint enow for anythin'. Him showin' theeth' way! Him! Eh! tha' young nowt,""—she could see his next words burstout because he was overpowered by curiosity—""however i' this world didtha' get in?""""It was the robin who showed me the way,"" she protested obstinately. ""Hedidn't know he was doing it but he did. And I can't tell you from herewhile you're shaking your fist at me.""He stopped shaking his fist very suddenly at that very moment and hisjaw actually dropped as he stared over her head at something he sawcoming over the grass toward him.At the first sound of his torrent of words Colin had been so surprisedthat he had only sat up and listened as if he were spellbound. But inthe midst of it he had recovered himself and beckoned imperiously toDickon.""Wheel me over there!"" he commanded. ""Wheel me quite close and stopright in front of him!""And this, if you please, this is what Ben Weatherstaff beheld and whichmade his jaw drop. A wheeled chair with luxurious cushions and robeswhich came toward him looking rather like some sort of State Coachbecause a young Rajah leaned back in it with royal command in his greatblack-rimmed eyes and a thin white hand extended haughtily toward him.And it stopped right under Ben Weatherstaff's nose. It was really nowonder his mouth dropped open.""Do you know who I am?"" demanded the Rajah.How Ben Weatherstaff stared! His red old eyes fixed themselves on whatwas before him as if he were seeing a ghost. He gazed and gazed andgulped a lump down his throat and did not say a word.""Do you know who I am?"" demanded Colin still more imperiously. ""Answer!""Ben Weatherstaff put his gnarled hand up and passed it over his eyes andover his forehead and then he did answer in a queer shaky voice.""Who tha' art?"" he said. ""Aye, that I do—wi' tha' mother's eyes starin'at me out o' tha' face. Lord knows how tha' come here. But tha'rt th'poor cripple.""Colin forgot that he had ever had a back. His face flushed scarlet andhe sat bolt upright.""I'm not a cripple!"" he cried out furiously. ""I'm not!""""He's not!"" cried Mary, almost shouting up the wall in her fierceindignation. ""He's not got a lump as big as a pin! I looked and therewas none there—not one!""Ben Weatherstaff passed his hand over his forehead again and gazed as ifhe could never gaze enough. His hand shook and his mouth shook and hisvoice shook. He was an ignorant old man and a tactless old man and hecould only remember the things he had heard.""Tha'—tha' hasn't got a crooked back?"" he said hoarsely.""No!"" shouted Colin.""Tha'—tha' hasn't got crooked legs?"" quavered Ben more hoarsely yet.It was too much. The strength which Colin usually threw into histantrums rushed through him now in a new way. Never yet had he beenaccused of crooked legs—even in whispers—and the perfectly simplebelief in their existence which was revealed by Ben Weatherstaff's voicewas more than Rajah flesh and blood could endure. His anger and insultedpride made him forget everything but this one moment and filled him witha power he had never known before, an almost unnatural strength.""Come here!"" he shouted to Dickon, and he actually began to tear thecoverings off his lower limbs and disentangle himself. ""Come here! Comehere! This minute!""Dickon was by his side in a second. Mary caught her breath in a shortgasp and felt herself turn pale.""He can do it! He can do it! He can do it! He can!"" she gabbled over toherself under her breath as fast as ever she could.There was a brief fierce scramble, the rugs were tossed on to theground, Dickon held Colin's arm, the thin legs were out, the thin feetwere on the grass. Colin was standing upright—upright—as straight asan arrow and looking strangely tall—his head thrown back and hisstrange eyes flashing lightning.""Look at me!"" he flung up at Ben Weatherstaff. ""Just look at me—you!Just look at me!""""He's as straight as I am!"" cried Dickon. ""He's as straight as any ladi' Yorkshire!""What Ben Weatherstaff did Mary thought queer beyond measure. He chokedand gulped and suddenly tears ran down his weather-wrinkled cheeks as hestruck his old hands together.""Eh!"" he burst forth, ""th' lies folk tells! Tha'rt as thin as a lath an'as white as a wraith, but there's not a knob on thee. Tha'lt make a monyet. God bless thee!""Dickon held Colin's arm strongly but the boy had not begun to falter. Hestood straighter and straighter and looked Ben Weatherstaff in the face.""I'm your master,"" he said, ""when my father is away. And you are to obeyme. This is my garden. Don't dare to say a word about it! You get downfrom that ladder and go out to the Long Walk and Miss Mary will meet youand bring you here. I want to talk to you. We did not want you, but nowyou will have to be in the secret. Be quick!""Ben Weatherstaff's crabbed old face was still wet with that one queerrush of tears. It seemed as if he could not take his eyes from thinstraight Colin standing on his feet with his head thrown back.""Eh! lad,"" he almost whispered. ""Eh! my lad!"" And then rememberinghimself he suddenly touched his hat gardener fashion and said, ""Yes,sir! Yes, sir!"" and obediently disappeared as he descended the ladder."

There were scarlet spots on hischeeks and he looked amazing, but he showed no signs of falling.""I can stand,"" he said, and his head was still held up and he said itquite grandly.""I told thee tha' could as soon as tha' stopped bein' afraid,"" answeredDickon. ""An' tha's stopped.""""Yes, I've stopped,"" said Colin.Then suddenly he remembered something Mary had said.""Are you making Magic?"" he asked sharply.Dickon's curly mouth spread in a cheerful grin.""Tha's doin' Magic thysel',"" he said. ""It's same Magic as made these'ere work out o' th' earth,"" and he touched with his thick boot a clumpof crocuses in the grass.Colin looked down at them.""Aye,"" he said slowly, ""there couldna' be bigger Magic then thatthere—there couldna' be.""He drew himself up straighter than ever.""I'm going to walk to that tree,"" he said, pointing to one a few feetaway from him. ""I'm going to be standing when Weatherstaff comes here. Ican rest against the tree if I like. When I want to sit down I will sitdown, but not before. Bring a rug from the chair.""He walked to the tree and though Dickon held his arm he was wonderfullysteady. When he stood against the tree trunk it was not too plain thathe supported himself against it, and he still held himself so straightthat he looked tall.When Ben Weatherstaff came through the door in the wall he saw himstanding there and he heard Mary muttering something under her breath.""What art sayin'?"" he asked rather testily because he did not want hisattention distracted from the long thin straight boy figure and proudface.But she did not tell him. What she was saying was this:""You can do it! You can do it! I told you you could! You can do it! Youcan do it! You can!""She was saying it to Colin because she wanted to make Magic and keep himon his feet looking like that. She could not bear that he should give inbefore Ben Weatherstaff. He did not give in. She was uplifted by asudden feeling that he looked quite beautiful in spite of his thinness.He fixed his eyes on Ben Weatherstaff in his funny imperious way.""Look at me!"" he commanded. ""Look at me all over! Am I a hunchback? HaveI got crooked legs?""Ben Weatherstaff had not quite got over his emotion, but he hadrecovered a little and answered almost in his usual way.""Not tha',"" he said. ""Nowt o' th' sort. What's tha' been doin' withthysel'—? hidin' out o' sight an' lettin' folk think tha' was cripplean' half-witted?""""Half-witted!"" said Colin angrily. ""Who thought that?""""Lots o' fools,"" said Ben. ""Th' world's full o' jackasses brayin' an'they never bray nowt but lies. What did tha' shut thysel' up for?""""Every one thought I was going to die,"" said Colin shortly. ""I'm not!""And he said it with such decision Ben Weatherstaff looked him over, upand down, down and up.""Tha' die!"" he said with dry exultation. ""Nowt o' th' sort! Tha's gottoo much pluck in thee. When I seed thee put tha' legs on th' ground insuch a hurry I knowed tha' was all right. Sit thee down on th' rug a bityoung Mester an' give me thy orders.""There was a queer mixture of crabbed tenderness and shrewd understandingin his manner. Mary had poured out speech as rapidly as she could asthey had come down the Long Walk. The chief thing to be remembered, shehad told him, was that Colin was getting well—getting well. The gardenwas doing it. No one must let him remember about having humps and dying.The Rajah condescended to seat himself on a rug under the tree.""What work do you do in the gardens, Weatherstaff?"" he inquired.""Anythin' I'm told to do,"" answered old Ben. ""I'm kep' on byfavor—because she liked me.""""She?"" said Colin.""Tha' mother,"" answered Ben Weatherstaff.""My mother?"" said Colin, and he looked about him quietly. ""This was hergarden, wasn't it?""""Aye, it was that!"" and Ben Weatherstaff looked about him too. ""She weremain fond of it.""""It is my garden now, I am fond of it. I shall come here every day,""announced Colin. ""But it is to be a secret. My orders are that no one isto know that we come here. Dickon and my cousin have worked and made itcome alive. I shall send for you sometimes to help—but you must comewhen no one can see you.""Ben Weatherstaff's face twisted itself in a dry old smile.""I've come here before when no one saw me,"" he said.""What!"" exclaimed Colin. ""When?""""Th' last time I was here,"" rubbing his chin and looking round, ""wasabout two year' ago.""""But no one has been in it for ten years!"" cried Colin. ""There was nodoor!""""I'm no one,"" said old Ben dryly. ""An' I didn't come through th' door. Icome over th' wall. Th' rheumatics held me back th' last two year'.""""Tha' come an' did a bit o' prunin'!"" cried Dickon. ""I couldn't make outhow it had been done.""""She was so fond of it—she was!"" said Ben Weatherstaff slowly. ""An' shewas such a pretty young thing. She says to me once, 'Ben,' says shelaughin', 'if ever I'm ill or if I go away you must take care of myroses.' When she did go away th' orders was no one was ever to comenigh. But I come,"" with grumpy obstinacy. ""Over th' wall I come—untilth' rheumatics stopped me—an' I did a bit o' work once a year. She'dgave her order first.""""It wouldn't have been as wick as it is if tha' hadn't done it,"" saidDickon. ""I did wonder.""""I'm glad you did it, Weatherstaff,"" said Colin. ""You'll know how tokeep the secret.""""Aye, I'll know, sir,"" answered Ben. ""An' it'll be easier for a man wi'rheumatics to come in at th' door.""On the grass near the tree Mary had dropped her trowel. Colin stretchedout his hand and took it up. An odd expression came into his face and hebegan to scratch at the earth. His thin hand was weak enough butpresently as they watched him—Mary with quite breathless interest—hedrove the end of the trowel into the soil and turned some over.""You can do it! You can do it!"" said Mary to herself. ""I tell you, youcan!""Dickon's round eyes were full of eager curiousness but he said not aword. Ben Weatherstaff looked on with interested face.Colin persevered. After he had turned a few trowelfuls of soil he spokeexultantly to Dickon in his best Yorkshire.""Tha' said as tha'd have me walkin' about here same as other folk—an'tha' said tha'd have me diggin'. I thowt tha' was just leein' to pleaseme. This is only th' first day an' I've walked—an' here I am diggin'.""Ben Weatherstaff's mouth fell open again when he heard him, but he endedby chuckling.""Eh!"" he said, ""that sounds as if tha'd got wits enow. Tha'rt aYorkshire lad for sure. An' tha'rt diggin', too. How'd tha' like toplant a bit o' somethin'? I can get thee a rose in a pot.""""Go and get it!"" said Colin, digging excitedly. ""Quick! Quick!""It was done quickly enough indeed. Ben Weatherstaff went his wayforgetting rheumatics. Dickon took his spade and dug the hole deeper andwider than a new digger with thin white hands could make it. Maryslipped out to run and bring back a watering-can. When Dickon haddeepened the hole Colin went on turning the soft earth over and over. Helooked up at the sky, flushed and glowing with the strangely newexercise, slight as it was.""I want to do it before the sun goes quite—quite down,"" he said.Mary thought that perhaps the sun held back a few minutes just onpurpose. Ben Weatherstaff brought the rose in its pot from thegreenhouse. He hobbled over the grass as fast as he could. He had begunto be excited, too. He knelt down by the hole and broke the pot from themould.""Here, lad,"" he said, handing the plant to Colin. ""Set it in the earththysel' same as th' king does when he goes to a new place.""The thin white hands shook a little and Colin's flush grew deeper as heset the rose in the mould and held it while old Ben made firm the earth.It was filled in and pressed down and made steady. Mary was leaningforward on her hands and knees. Soot had flown down and marched forwardto see what was being done. Nut and Shell chattered about it from acherry-tree.""It's planted!"" said Colin at last. ""And the sun is only slipping overthe edge. Help me up, Dickon. I want to be standing when it goes. That'spart of the Magic.""And Dickon helped him, and the Magic—or whatever it was—so gave himstrength that when the sun did slip over the edge and end the strangelovely afternoon for them there he actually stood on his twofeet—laughing."

He had indeed begun to wonder if it might not be wise to send someone out to explore the garden paths. When Colin was brought back to hisroom the poor man looked him over seriously.""You should not have stayed so long,"" he said. ""You must not overexertyourself.""""I am not tired at all,"" said Colin. ""It has made me well. To-morrow Iam going out in the morning as well as in the afternoon.""""I am not sure that I can allow it,"" answered Dr. Craven. ""I am afraidit would not be wise.""""It would not be wise to try to stop me,"" said Colin quite seriously. ""Iam going.""Even Mary had found out that one of Colin's chief peculiarities was thathe did not know in the least what a rude little brute he was with hisway of ordering people about. He had lived on a sort of desert islandall his life and as he had been the king of it he had made his ownmanners and had had no one to compare himself with. Mary had indeedbeen rather like him herself and since she had been at Misselthwaite hadgradually discovered that her own manners had not been of the kind whichis usual or popular. Having made this discovery she naturally thought itof enough interest to communicate to Colin. So she sat and looked at himcuriously for a few minutes after Dr. Craven had gone. She wanted tomake him ask her why she was doing it and of course she did.""What are you looking at me for?"" he said.""I'm thinking that I am rather sorry for Dr. Craven.""""So am I,"" said Colin calmly, but not without an air of somesatisfaction. ""He won't get Misselthwaite at all now I'm not going todie.""""I'm sorry for him because of that, of course,"" said Mary, ""but I wasthinking just then that it must have been very horrid to have had to bepolite for ten years to a boy who was always rude. I would never havedone it.""""Am I rude?"" Colin inquired undisturbedly.""If you had been his own boy and he had been a slapping sort of man,""said Mary, ""he would have slapped you.""""But he daren't,"" said Colin.""No, he daren't,"" answered Mistress Mary, thinking the thing out quitewithout prejudice. ""Nobody ever dared to do anything you didn'tlike—because you were going to die and things like that. You were sucha poor thing.""""But,"" announced Colin stubbornly, ""I am not going to be a poor thing. Iwon't let people think I'm one. I stood on my feet this afternoon.""""It is always having your own way that has made you so queer,"" Mary wenton, thinking aloud.Colin turned his head, frowning.""Am I queer?"" he demanded.""Yes,"" answered Mary, ""very. But you needn't be cross,"" she addedimpartially, ""because so am I queer—and so is Ben Weatherstaff. But Iam not as queer as I was before I began to like people and before Ifound the garden.""""I don't want to be queer,"" said Colin. ""I am not going to be,"" and hefrowned again with determination.He was a very proud boy. He lay thinking for a while and then Mary sawhis beautiful smile begin and gradually change his whole face.""I shall stop being queer,"" he said, ""if I go every day to the garden.There is Magic in there—good Magic, you know, Mary. I am sure thereis.""""So am I,"" said Mary.""Even if it isn't real Magic,"" Colin said, ""we can pretend it is.Something is there—something!""""It's Magic,"" said Mary, ""but not black. It's as white as snow.""They always called it Magic and indeed it seemed like it in the monthsthat followed—the wonderful months—the radiant months—the amazingones. Oh! the things which happened in that garden! If you have neverhad a garden, you cannot understand, and if you have had a garden youwill know that it would take a whole book to describe all that came topass there. At first it seemed that green things would never ceasepushing their way through the earth, in the grass, in the beds, even inthe crevices of the walls. Then the green things began to show buds andthe buds began to unfurl and show color, every shade of blue, everyshade of purple, every tint and hue of crimson. In its happy daysflowers had been tucked away into every inch and hole and corner. BenWeatherstaff had seen it done and had himself scraped out mortar frombetween the bricks of the wall and made pockets of earth for lovelyclinging things to grow on. Iris and white lilies rose out of the grassin sheaves, and the green alcoves filled themselves with amazing armiesof the blue and white flower lances of tall delphiniums or columbinesor campanulas.""She was main fond o' them—she was,"" Ben Weatherstaff said. ""She likedthem things as was allus pointin' up to th' blue sky, she used to tell.Not as she was one o' them as looked down on th' earth—not her. Shejust loved it but she said as th' blue sky allus looked so joyful.""The seeds Dickon and Mary had planted grew as if fairies had tendedthem. Satiny poppies of all tints danced in the breeze by the score,gaily defying flowers which had lived in the garden for years and whichit might be confessed seemed rather to wonder how such new people hadgot there. And the roses—the roses! Rising out of the grass, tangledround the sun-dial, wreathing the tree trunks and hanging from theirbranches, climbing up the walls and spreading over them with longgarlands falling in cascades—they came alive day by day, hour by hour.Fair fresh leaves, and buds—and buds—tiny at first but swelling andworking Magic until they burst and uncurled into cups of scentdelicately spilling themselves over their brims and filling the gardenair.Colin saw it all, watching each change as it took place. Every morninghe was brought out and every hour of each day when it didn't rain hespent in the garden. Even gray days pleased him. He would lie on thegrass ""watching things growing,"" he said. If you watched long enough, hedeclared, you could see buds unsheath themselves. Also you could makethe acquaintance of strange busy insect things running about on variousunknown but evidently serious errands, sometimes carrying tiny scraps ofstraw or feather or food, or climbing blades of grass as if they weretrees from whose tops one could look out to explore the country. A molethrowing up its mound at the end of its burrow and making its way out atlast with the long-nailed paws which looked so like elfish hands, hadabsorbed him one whole morning. Ants' ways, beetles' ways, bees' ways,frogs' ways, birds' ways, plants' ways, gave him a new world to exploreand when Dickon revealed them all and added foxes' ways, otters' ways,ferrets' ways, squirrels' ways, and trout's and water-rats' and badgers'ways, there was no end to the things to talk about and think over.And this was not the half of the Magic. The fact that he had really oncestood on his feet had set Colin thinking tremendously and when Mary toldhim of the spell she had worked he was excited and approved of itgreatly. He talked of it constantly.""Of course there must be lots of Magic in the world,"" he said wiselyone day, ""but people don't know what it is like or how to make it.Perhaps the beginning is just to say nice things are going to happenuntil you make them happen. I am going to try and experiment.""The next morning when they went to the secret garden he sent at once forBen Weatherstaff. Ben came as quickly as he could and found the Rajahstanding on his feet under a tree and looking very grand but also verybeautifully smiling.""Good morning, Ben Weatherstaff,"" he said. ""I want you and Dickon andMiss Mary to stand in a row and listen to me because I am going to tellyou something very important.""""Aye, aye, sir!"" answered Ben Weatherstaff, touching his forehead. (Oneof the long concealed charms of Ben Weatherstaff was that in his boyhoodhe had once run away to sea and had made voyages. So he could reply likea sailor.)""I am going to try a scientific experiment,"" explained the Rajah. ""WhenI grow up I am going to make great scientific discoveries and I am goingto begin now with this experiment.""""Aye, aye, sir!"" said Ben Weatherstaff promptly, though this was thefirst time he had heard of great scientific discoveries.It was the first time Mary had heard of them, either, but even at thisstage she had begun to realize that, queer as he was, Colin had readabout a great many singular things and was somehow a very convincingsort of boy. When he held up his head and fixed his strange eyes on youit seemed as if you believed him almost in spite of yourself though hewas only ten years old—going on eleven. At this moment he wasespecially convincing because he suddenly felt the fascination ofactually making a sort of speech like a grown-up person.""The great scientific discoveries I am going to make,"" he went on, ""willbe about Magic. Magic is a great thing and scarcely any one knowsanything about it except a few people in old books—and Mary a little,because she was born in India where there are fakirs. I believe Dickonknows some Magic, but perhaps he doesn't know he knows it. He charmsanimals and people. I would never have let him come to see me if he hadnot been an animal charmer—which is a boy charmer, too, because a boyis an animal. I am sure there is Magic in everything, only we have notsense enough to get hold of it and make it do things for us—likeelectricity and horses and steam.""This sounded so imposing that Ben Weatherstaff became quite excited andreally could not keep still.""Aye, aye, sir,"" he said and he began to stand up quite straight.""When Mary found this garden it looked quite dead,"" the oratorproceeded. ""Then something began pushing things up out of the soil andmaking things out of nothing. One day things weren't there and anotherthey were. I had never watched things before and it made me feel verycurious. Scientific people are always curious and I am going to bescientific. I keep saying to myself, 'What is it? What is it?' It'ssomething. It can't be nothing! I don't know its name so I call itMagic. I have never seen the sun rise but Mary and Dickon have and fromwhat they tell me I am sure that is Magic too. Something pushes it upand draws it. Sometimes since I've been in the garden I've looked upthrough the trees at the sky and I have had a strange feeling of beinghappy as if something were pushing and drawing in my chest and making mebreathe fast. Magic is always pushing and drawing and making things outof nothing. Everything is made out of Magic, leaves and trees, flowersand birds, badgers and foxes and squirrels and people. So it must be allaround us. In this garden—in all the places. The Magic in this gardenhas made me stand up and know I am going to live to be a man. I am goingto make the scientific experiment of trying to get some and put it inmyself and make it push and draw me and make me strong. I don't know howto do it but I think that if you keep thinking about it and calling itperhaps it will come. Perhaps that is the first baby way to get it. WhenI was going to try to stand that first time Mary kept saying to herselfas fast as she could, 'You can do it! You can do it!' and I did. I hadto try myself at the same time, of course, but her Magic helped me—andso did Dickon's. Every morning and evening and as often in the daytimeas I can remember I am going to say, 'Magic is in me! Magic is making mewell! I am going to be as strong as Dickon, as strong as Dickon!' Andyou must all do it, too. That is my experiment. Will you help, BenWeatherstaff?""""Aye, aye, sir!"" said Ben Weatherstaff. ""Aye, aye!""""If you keep doing it every day as regularly as soldiers go throughdrill we shall see what will happen and find out if the experimentsucceeds. You learn things by saying them over and over and thinkingabout them until they stay in your mind forever and I think it will bethe same with Magic. If you keep calling it to come to you and help youit will get to be part of you and it will stay and do things.""""I once heard an officer in India tell my mother that there were fakirswho said words over and over thousands of times,"" said Mary.""I've heard Jem Fettleworth's wife say th' same thing over thousands o'times—callin' Jem a drunken brute,"" said Ben Weatherstaff dryly.""Summat allus come o' that, sure enough. He gave her a good hidin' an'went to th' Blue Lion an' got as drunk as a lord.""Colin drew his brows together and thought a few minutes. Then he cheeredup.""Well,"" he said, ""you see something did come of it. She used the wrongMagic until she made him beat her. If she'd used the right Magic and hadsaid something nice perhaps he wouldn't have got as drunk as a lord andperhaps—perhaps he might have bought her a new bonnet.""Ben Weatherstaff chuckled and there was shrewd admiration in his littleold eyes.""Tha'rt a clever lad as well as a straight-legged one, Mester Colin,"" hesaid. ""Next time I see Bess Fettleworth I'll give her a bit of a hint o'what Magic will do for her. She'd be rare an' pleased if th' sinetifik'speriment worked—an' so 'ud Jem.""Dickon had stood listening to the lecture, his round eyes shining withcurious delight. Nut and Shell were on his shoulders and he held along-eared white rabbit in his arm and stroked and stroked it softlywhile it laid its ears along its back and enjoyed itself.""Do you think the experiment will work?"" Colin asked him, wondering whathe was thinking. He so often wondered what Dickon was thinking when hesaw him looking at him or at one of his ""creatures"" with his happy widesmile.He smiled now and his smile was wider than usual.""Aye,"" he answered, ""that I do. It'll work same as th' seeds do when th'sun shines on 'em. It'll work for sure. Shall us begin it now?""Colin was delighted and so was Mary. Fired by recollections of fakirsand devotees in illustrations Colin suggested that they should all sitcross-legged under the tree which made a canopy.""It will be like sitting in a sort of temple,"" said Colin. ""I'm rathertired and I want to sit down.""""Eh!"" said Dickon, ""tha' musn't begin by sayin' tha'rt tired. Tha' mightspoil th' Magic.""Colin turned and looked at him—into his innocent round eyes.""That's true,"" he said slowly. ""I must only think of the Magic.""It all seemed most majestic and mysterious when they sat down in theircircle. Ben Weatherstaff felt as if he had somehow been led intoappearing at a prayer-meeting. Ordinarily he was very fixed in beingwhat he called ""agen' prayer-meetin's"" but this being the Rajah's affairhe did not resent it and was indeed inclined to be gratified at beingcalled upon to assist. Mistress Mary felt solemnly enraptured. Dickonheld his rabbit in his arm, and perhaps he made some charmer's signal noone heard, for when he sat down, cross-legged like the rest, the crow,the fox, the squirrels and the lamb slowly drew near and made part ofthe circle, settling each into a place of rest as if of their owndesire.""The 'creatures' have come,"" said Colin gravely. ""They want to help us.""Colin really looked quite beautiful, Mary thought. He held his head highas if he felt like a sort of priest and his strange eyes had a wonderfullook in them. The light shone on him through the tree canopy.""Now we will begin,"" he said. ""Shall we sway backward and forward, Mary,as if we were dervishes?""""I canna' do no swayin' back'ard and for'ard,"" said Ben Weatherstaff.""I've got th' rheumatics.""""The Magic will take them away,"" said Colin in a High Priest tone, ""butwe won't sway until it has done it. We will only chant.""""I canna' do no chantin',"" said Ben Weatherstaff a trifle testily. ""Theyturned me out o' th' church choir th' only time I ever tried it.""No one smiled. They were all too much in earnest. Colin's face was noteven crossed by a shadow. He was thinking only of the Magic.""Then I will chant,"" he said. And he began, looking like a strange boyspirit. ""The sun is shining—the sun is shining. That is the Magic. Theflowers are growing—the roots are stirring. That is the Magic. Beingalive is the Magic—being strong is the Magic. The Magic is in me—theMagic is in me. It is in me—it is in me. It's in every one of us. It'sin Ben Weatherstaff's back. Magic! Magic! Come and help!""He said it a great many times—not a thousand times but quite a goodlynumber. Mary listened entranced. She felt as if it were at once queerand beautiful and she wanted him to go on and on. Ben Weatherstaff beganto feel soothed into a sort of dream which was quite agreeable. Thehumming of the bees in the blossoms mingled with the chanting voice anddrowsily melted into a doze. Dickon sat cross-legged with his rabbitasleep on his arm and a hand resting on the lamb's back. Soot hadpushed away a squirrel and huddled close to him on his shoulder, thegray film dropped over his eyes. At last Colin stopped.""Now I am going to walk round the garden,"" he announced.Ben Weatherstaff's head had just dropped forward and he lifted it with ajerk.""You have been asleep,"" said Colin.""Nowt o' th' sort,"" mumbled Ben. ""Th' sermon was good enow—but I'mbound to get out afore th' collection.""He was not quite awake yet.""You're not in church,"" said Colin.""Not me,"" said Ben, straightening himself. ""Who said I were? I heardevery bit of it. You said th' Magic was in my back. Th' doctor calls itrheumatics.""The Rajah waved his hand.""That was the wrong Magic,"" he said. ""You will get better. You have mypermission to go to your work. But come back to-morrow.""""I'd like to see thee walk round the garden,"" grunted Ben.It was not an unfriendly grunt, but it was a grunt. In fact, being astubborn old party and not having entire faith in Magic he had made uphis mind that if he were sent away he would climb his ladder and lookover the wall so that he might be ready to hobble back if there were anystumbling.The Rajah did not object to his staying and so the procession wasformed. It really did look like a procession. Colin was at its head withDickon on one side and Mary on the other. Ben Weatherstaff walkedbehind, and the ""creatures"" trailed after them, the lamb and the fox cubkeeping close to Dickon, the white rabbit hopping along or stopping tonibble and Soot following with the solemnity of a person who felthimself in charge.It was a procession which moved slowly but with dignity. Every few yardsit stopped to rest. Colin leaned on Dickon's arm and privately BenWeatherstaff kept a sharp lookout, but now and then Colin took his handfrom its support and walked a few steps alone. His head was held up allthe time and he looked very grand.""The Magic is in me!"" he kept saying. ""The Magic is making me strong! Ican feel it! I can feel it!""It seemed very certain that something was upholding and uplifting him.He sat on the seats in the alcoves, and once or twice he sat down on thegrass and several times he paused in the path and leaned on Dickon, buthe would not give up until he had gone all round the garden. When hereturned to the canopy tree his cheeks were flushed and he lookedtriumphant.""I did it! The Magic worked!"" he cried. ""That is my first scientificdiscovery.""""What will Dr. Craven say?"" broke out Mary.""He won't say anything,"" Colin answered, ""because he will not be told.This is to be the biggest secret of all. No one is to know anythingabout it until I have grown so strong that I can walk and run like anyother boy. I shall come here every day in my chair and I shall be takenback in it. I won't have people whispering and asking questions and Iwon't let my father hear about it until the experiment has quitesucceeded. Then sometime when he comes back to Misselthwaite I shalljust walk into his study and say 'Here I am; I am like any other boy. Iam quite well and I shall live to be a man. It has been done by ascientific experiment.'""""He will think he is in a dream,"" cried Mary. ""He won't believe hiseyes.""Colin flushed triumphantly. He had made himself believe that he wasgoing to get well, which was really more than half the battle, if he hadbeen aware of it. And the thought which stimulated him more than anyother was this imagining what his father would look like when he sawthat he had a son who was as straight and strong as other fathers'sons. One of his darkest miseries in the unhealthy morbid past days hadbeen his hatred of being a sickly weak-backed boy whose father wasafraid to look at him.""He'll be obliged to believe them,"" he said. ""One of the things I amgoing to do, after the Magic works and before I begin to make scientificdiscoveries, is to be an athlete.""""We shall have thee takin' to boxin' in a week or so,"" said BenWeatherstaff. ""Tha'lt end wi' winnin' th' Belt an' bein' championprize-fighter of all England.""Colin fixed his eyes on him sternly.""Weatherstaff,"" he said, ""that is disrespectful. You must not takeliberties because you are in the secret. However much the Magic works Ishall not be a prize-fighter. I shall be a Scientific Discoverer.""""Ax pardon—ax pardon, sir,"" answered Ben, touching his forehead insalute. ""I ought to have seed it wasn't a jokin' matter,"" but his eyestwinkled and secretly he was immensely pleased. He really did not mindbeing snubbed since the snubbing meant that the lad was gaining strengthand spirit."

Round thecottage on the moor there was a piece of ground enclosed by a low wallof rough stones. Early in the morning and late in the fading twilightand on all the days Colin and Mary did not see him, Dickon worked thereplanting or tending potatoes and cabbages, turnips and carrots and herbsfor his mother. In the company of his ""creatures"" he did wonders thereand was never tired of doing them, it seemed. While he dug or weeded hewhistled or sang bits of Yorkshire moor songs or talked to Soot orCaptain or the brothers and sisters he had taught to help him.""We'd never get on as comfortable as we do,"" Mrs. Sowerby said, ""if itwasn't for Dickon's garden. Anything'll grow for him. His 'taters andcabbages is twice th' size of any one else's an' they've got a flavorwith 'em as nobody's has.""When she found a moment to spare she liked to go out and talk to him.After supper there was still a long clear twilight to work in and thatwas her quiet time. She could sit upon the low rough wall and look onand hear stories of the day. She loved this time. There were not onlyvegetables in this garden. Dickon had bought penny packages of flowerseeds now and then and sown bright sweet-scented things among gooseberrybushes and even cabbages and he grew borders of mignonette and pinks andpansies and things whose seeds he could save year after year or whoseroots would bloom each spring and spread in time into fine clumps. Thelow wall was one of the prettiest things in Yorkshire because he hadtucked moorland foxglove and ferns and rock-cress and hedgerow flowersinto every crevice until only here and there glimpses of the stones wereto be seen.""All a chap's got to do to make 'em thrive, mother,"" he would say, ""isto be friends with 'em for sure. They're just like th' 'creatures.' Ifthey're thirsty give 'em a drink and if they're hungry give 'em a bit o'food. They want to live same as we do. If they died I should feel as ifI'd been a bad lad and somehow treated them heartless.""It was in these twilight hours that Mrs. Sowerby heard of all thathappened at Misselthwaite Manor. At first she was only told that""Mester Colin"" had taken a fancy to going out into the grounds withMiss Mary and that it was doing him good. But it was not long before itwas agreed between the two children that Dickon's mother might ""comeinto the secret."" Somehow it was not doubted that she was ""safe forsure.""So one beautiful still evening Dickon told the whole story, with all thethrilling details of the buried key and the robin and the gray hazewhich had seemed like deadness and the secret Mistress Mary had plannednever to reveal. The coming of Dickon and how it had been told to him,the doubt of Mester Colin and the final drama of his introduction to thehidden domain, combined with the incident of Ben Weatherstaff's angryface peering over the wall and Mester Colin's sudden indignant strength,made Mrs. Sowerby's nice-looking face quite change color several times.""My word!"" she said. ""It was a good thing that little lass came to th'Manor. It's been th' makin' o' her an' th' savin' o' him. Standin' onhis feet! An' us all thinkin' he was a poor half-witted lad with not astraight bone in him.""She asked a great many questions and her blue eyes were full of deepthinking.""What do they make of it at th' Manor—him being so well an' cheerfulan' never complainin'?"" she inquired.""They don't know what to make of it,"" answered Dickon. ""Every day ascomes round his face looks different. It's fillin' out and doesn't lookso sharp an' th' waxy color is goin'. But he has to do his bit o'complainin',"" with a highly entertained grin.""What for, i' Mercy's name?"" asked Mrs. Sowerby.Dickon chuckled.""He does it to keep them from guessin' what's happened. If the doctorknew he'd found out he could stand on his feet he'd likely write andtell Mester Craven. Mester Colin's savin' th' secret to tell himself.He's goin' to practise his Magic on his legs every day till his fathercomes back an' then he's goin' to march into his room an' show him he'sas straight as other lads. But him an' Miss Mary thinks it's best planto do a bit o' groanin' an' frettin' now an' then to throw folk off th'scent.""Mrs. Sowerby was laughing a low comfortable laugh long before he hadfinished his last sentence.""Eh!"" she said, ""that pair's enjoyin' theirselves, I'll warrant. They'llget a good bit o' play actin' out of it an' there's nothin' childrenlikes as much as play actin'. Let's hear what they do, Dickon lad.""Dickon stopped weeding and sat up on his heels to tell her. His eyeswere twinkling with fun.""Mester Colin is carried down to his chair every time he goes out,"" heexplained. ""An' he flies out at John, th' footman, for not carryin' himcareful enough. He makes himself as helpless lookin' as he can an' neverlifts his head until we're out o' sight o' th' house. An' he grunts an'frets a good bit when he's bein' settled into his chair. Him an' MissMary's both got to enjoyin' it an' when he groans an' complains she'llsay, 'Poor Colin! Does it hurt you so much? Are you so weak as that,poor Colin?'—but th' trouble is that sometimes they can scarce keepfrom burstin' out laughin'. When we get safe into the garden they laughtill they've no breath left to laugh with. An' they have to stuff theirfaces into Mester Colin's cushions to keep the gardeners from hearin',if any of 'em's about.""""Th' more they laugh th' better for 'em!"" said Mrs. Sowerby, stilllaughing herself. ""Good healthy child laughin's better than pills anyday o' th' year. That pair'll plump up for sure.""""They are plumpin' up,"" said Dickon. ""They're that hungry they don'tknow how to get enough to eat without makin' talk. Mester Colin says ifhe keeps sendin' for more food they won't believe he's an invalid atall. Miss Mary says she'll let him eat her share, but he says that ifshe goes hungry she'll get thin an' they mun both get fat at once.""Mrs. Sowerby laughed so heartily at the revelation of this difficulty,that she quite rocked backward and forward in her blue cloak, and Dickonlaughed with her.""I'll tell thee what, lad,"" Mrs. Sowerby said when she could speak.""I've thought of a way to help 'em. When tha' goes to 'em in th'mornin's tha' shall take a pail o' good new milk an' I'll bake 'em acrusty cottage loaf or some buns wi' currants in 'em, same as youchildren like. Nothin's so good as fresh milk an' bread. Then they couldtake off th' edge o' their hunger while they were in their garden an'th' fine food they get indoors 'ud polish off th' corners.""""Eh! mother!"" said Dickon admiringly, ""what a wonder tha' art! Tha'always sees a way out o' things. They was quite in a pother yesterday.They didn't see how they was to manage without orderin' up morefood—they felt that empty inside.""""They're two young 'uns growin' fast, an' health's comin' back to both of'em. Children like that feels like young wolves an' food's flesh an'blood to 'em,"" said Mrs. Sowerby. Then she smiled Dickon's own curvingsmile. ""Eh! but they're enjoyin' theirselves for sure,"" she said.She was quite right, the comfortable wonderful mother creature—and shehad never been more so than when she said their ""play actin'"" would betheir joy. Colin and Mary found it one of their most thrilling sourcesof entertainment. The idea of protecting themselves from suspicion hadbeen unconsciously suggested to them first by the puzzled nurse and thenby Dr. Craven himself.""Your appetite is improving very much, Master Colin,"" the nurse had saidone day. ""You used to eat nothing, and so many things disagreed withyou.""""Nothing disagrees with me now,"" replied Colin, and then seeing thenurse looking at him curiously he suddenly remembered that perhaps heought not to appear too well just yet. ""At least things don't so oftendisagree with me. It's the fresh air.""""Perhaps it is,"" said the nurse, still looking at him with a mystifiedexpression. ""But I must talk to Dr. Craven about it.""""How she stared at you!"" said Mary when she went away. ""As if shethought there must be something to find out.""""I won't have her finding out things,"" said Colin. ""No one must begin tofind out yet."" When Dr. Craven came that morning he seemed puzzled,also. He asked a number of questions, to Colin's great annoyance.""You stay out in the garden a great deal,"" he suggested. ""Where do yougo?""Colin put on his favorite air of dignified indifference to opinion.""I will not let any one know where I go,"" he answered. ""I go to a placeI like. Every one has orders to keep out of the way. I won't be watchedand stared at. You know that!""""You seem to be out all day but I do not think it has done you harm—Ido not think so. The nurse says that you eat much more than you haveever done before.""""Perhaps,"" said Colin, prompted by a sudden inspiration, ""perhaps it isan unnatural appetite.""""I do not think so, as your food seems to agree with you,"" said Dr.Craven. ""You are gaining flesh rapidly and your color is better.""""Perhaps—perhaps I am bloated and feverish,"" said Colin, assuming adiscouraging air of gloom. ""People who are not going to live areoften—different.""Dr. Craven shook his head. He was holding Colin's wrist and he pushed uphis sleeve and felt his arm.""You are not feverish,"" he said thoughtfully, ""and such flesh as youhave gained is healthy. If we can keep this up, my boy, we need not talkof dying. Your father will be very happy to hear of this remarkableimprovement.""""I won't have him told!"" Colin broke forth fiercely. ""It will onlydisappoint him if I get worse again—and I may get worse this verynight. I might have a raging fever. I feel as if I might be beginning tohave one now. I won't have letters written to my father—I won't—Iwon't! You are making me angry and you know that is bad for me. I feelhot already. I hate being written about and being talked over as much asI hate being stared at!""""Hush-h! my boy,"" Dr. Craven soothed him. ""Nothing shall be writtenwithout your permission. You are too sensitive about things. You mustnot undo the good which has been done.""He said no more about writing to Mr. Craven and when he saw the nurse heprivately warned her that such a possibility must not be mentioned tothe patient.""The boy is extraordinarily better,"" he said. ""His advance seems almostabnormal. But of course he is doing now of his own free will what wecould not make him do before. Still, he excites himself very easily andnothing must be said to irritate him.""Mary and Colin were much alarmed and talked together anxiously. Fromthis time dated their plan of ""play actin'.""""I may be obliged to have a tantrum,"" said Colin regretfully. ""I don'twant to have one and I'm not miserable enough now to work myself into abig one. Perhaps I couldn't have one at all. That lump doesn't come inmy throat now and I keep thinking of nice things instead of horribleones. But if they talk about writing to my father I shall have to dosomething.""He made up his mind to eat less, but unfortunately it was not possibleto carry out this brilliant idea when he wakened each morning with anamazing appetite and the table near his sofa was set with a breakfast ofhome-made bread and fresh butter, snow-white eggs, raspberry jam andclotted cream. Mary always breakfasted with him and when they foundthemselves at the table—particularly if there were delicate slices ofsizzling ham sending forth tempting odors from under a hot silvercover—they would look into each other's eyes in desperation.""I think we shall have to eat it all this morning, Mary,"" Colin alwaysended by saying. ""We can send away some of the lunch and a great deal ofthe dinner.""But they never found they could send away anything and the highlypolished condition of the empty plates returned to the pantry awakenedmuch comment.""I do wish,"" Colin would say also, ""I do wish the slices of ham werethicker, and one muffin each is not enough for any one.""""It's enough for a person who is going to die,"" answered Mary when firstshe heard this, ""but it's not enough for a person who is going to live.I sometimes feel as if I could eat three when those nice fresh heatherand gorse smells from the moor come pouring in at the open window.""The morning that Dickon—after they had been enjoying themselves in thegarden for about two hours—went behind a big rose-bush and broughtforth two tin pails and revealed that one was full of rich new milk withcream on the top of it, and that the other held cottage-made currantbuns folded in a clean blue and white napkin, buns so carefully tuckedin that they were still hot, there was a riot of surprised joyfulness.What a wonderful thing for Mrs. Sowerby to think of! What a kind, cleverwoman she must be! How good the buns were! And what delicious freshmilk!""Magic is in her just as it is in Dickon,"" said Colin. ""It makes herthink of ways to do things—nice things. She is a Magic person. Tell herwe are grateful, Dickon—extremely grateful.""He was given to using rather grown-up phrases at times. He enjoyed them.He liked this so much that he improved upon it.""Tell her she has been most bounteous and our gratitude is extreme.""And then forgetting his grandeur he fell to and stuffed himself withbuns and drank milk out of the pail in copious draughts in the manner ofany hungry little boy who had been taking unusual exercise and breathingin moorland air and whose breakfast was more than two hours behind him.This was the beginning of many agreeable incidents of the same kind.They actually awoke to the fact that as Mrs. Sowerby had fourteen peopleto provide food for she might not have enough to satisfy two extraappetites every day. So they asked her to let them send some of theirshillings to buy things.Dickon made the stimulating discovery that in the wood in the parkoutside the garden where Mary had first found him piping to the wildcreatures there was a deep little hollow where you could build a sort oftiny oven with stones and roast potatoes and eggs in it. Roasted eggswere a previously unknown luxury and very hot potatoes with salt andfresh butter in them were fit for a woodland king—besides beingdeliciously satisfying. You could buy both potatoes and eggs and eat asmany as you liked without feeling as if you were taking food out of themouths of fourteen people.Every beautiful morning the Magic was worked by the mystic circle underthe plum-tree which provided a canopy of thickening green leaves afterits brief blossom-time was ended. After the ceremony Colin always tookhis walking exercise and throughout the day he exercised his newly foundpower at intervals. Each day he grew stronger and could walk moresteadily and cover more ground. And each day his belief in the Magicgrew stronger—as well it might. He tried one experiment after anotheras he felt himself gaining strength and it was Dickon who showed him thebest things of all.""Yesterday,"" he said one morning after an absence, ""I went to Thwaitefor mother an' near th' Blue Cow Inn I seed Bob Haworth. He's thestrongest chap on th' moor. He's the champion wrestler an' he can jumphigher than any other chap an' throw th' hammer farther. He's gone allth' way to Scotland for th' sports some years. He's knowed me ever sinceI was a little 'un an' he's a friendly sort an' I axed him somequestions. Th' gentry calls him a athlete and I thought o' thee, MesterColin, and I says, 'How did tha' make tha' muscles stick out that way,Bob? Did tha' do anythin' extra to make thysel' so strong?' An' he says'Well, yes, lad, I did. A strong man in a show that came to Thwaite onceshowed me how to exercise my arms an' legs an' every muscle in my body.'An' I says, 'Could a delicate chap make himself stronger with 'em, Bob?'an' he laughed an' says, 'Art tha' th' delicate chap?' an' I says, 'No,but I knows a young gentleman that's gettin' well of a long illness an'I wish I knowed some o' them tricks to tell him about.' I didn't say nonames an' he didn't ask none. He's friendly same as I said an' he stoodup an' showed me good-natured like, an' I imitated what he did till Iknowed it by heart.""Colin had been listening excitedly.""Can you show me?"" he cried. ""Will you?""""Aye, to be sure,"" Dickon answered, getting up. ""But he says tha' mun do'em gentle at first an' be careful not to tire thysel'. Rest in betweentimes an' take deep breaths an' don't overdo.""""I'll be careful,"" said Colin. ""Show me! Show me! Dickon, you are themost Magic boy in the world!""Dickon stood up on the grass and slowly went through a carefullypractical but simple series of muscle exercises. Colin watched them withwidening eyes. He could do a few while he was sitting down. Presently hedid a few gently while he stood upon his already steadied feet. Marybegan to do them also. Soot, who was watching the performance, becamemuch disturbed and left his branch and hopped about restlessly becausehe could not do them too.From that time the exercises were part of the day's duties as much asthe Magic was. It became possible for both Colin and Mary to do more ofthem each time they tried, and such appetites were the results that butfor the basket Dickon put down behind the bush each morning when hearrived they would have been lost. But the little oven in the hollow andMrs. Sowerby's bounties were so satisfying that Mrs. Medlock and thenurse and Dr. Craven became mystified again. You can trifle with yourbreakfast and seem to disdain your dinner if you are full to the brimwith roasted eggs and potatoes and richly frothed new milk and oat-cakesand buns and heather honey and clotted cream.""They are eating next to nothing,"" said the nurse. ""They'll die ofstarvation if they can't be persuaded to take some nourishment. And yetsee how they look.""""Look!"" exclaimed Mrs. Medlock indignantly. ""Eh! I'm moithered to deathwith them. They're a pair of young Satans. Bursting their jackets oneday and the next turning up their noses at the best meals Cook cantempt them with. Not a mouthful of that lovely young fowl and breadsauce did they set a fork into yesterday—and the poor woman fairinvented a pudding for them—and back it's sent. She almost cried.She's afraid she'll be blamed if they starve themselves into theirgraves.""Dr. Craven came and looked at Colin long and carefully. He wore anextremely worried expression when the nurse talked with him and showedhim the almost untouched tray of breakfast she had saved for him to lookat—but it was even more worried when he sat down by Colin's sofa andexamined him. He had been called to London on business and had not seenthe boy for nearly two weeks. When young things begin to gain healththey gain it rapidly. The waxen tinge had left Colin's skin and a warmrose showed through it; his beautiful eyes were clear and the hollowsunder them and in his cheeks and temples had filled out. His once dark,heavy locks had begun to look as if they sprang healthily from hisforehead and were soft and warm with life. His lips were fuller and of anormal color. In fact as an imitation of a boy who was a confirmedinvalid he was a disgraceful sight. Dr. Craven held his chin in his handand thought him over.""I am sorry to hear that you do not eat anything,"" he said. ""That willnot do. You will lose all you have gained—and you have gainedamazingly. You ate so well a short time ago.""""I told you it was an unnatural appetite,"" answered Colin.Mary was sitting on her stool nearby and she suddenly made a very queersound which she tried so violently to repress that she ended by almostchoking.""What is the matter?"" said Dr. Craven, turning to look at her.Mary became quite severe in her manner.""It was something between a sneeze and a cough,"" she replied withreproachful dignity, ""and it got into my throat.""""But"" she said afterward to Colin, ""I couldn't stop myself. It justburst out because all at once I couldn't help remembering that last bigpotato you ate and the way your mouth stretched when you bit throughthat thick lovely crust with jam and clotted cream on it.""""Is there any way in which those children can get food secretly?"" Dr.Craven inquired of Mrs. Medlock.""There's no way unless they dig it out of the earth or pick it off thetrees,"" Mrs. Medlock answered. ""They stay out in the grounds all day andsee no one but each other. And if they want anything different to eatfrom what's sent up to them they need only ask for it.""""Well,"" said Dr. Craven, ""so long as going without food agrees with themwe need not disturb ourselves. The boy is a new creature.""""So is the girl,"" said Mrs. Medlock. ""She's begun to be downright prettysince she's filled out and lost her ugly little sour look. Her hair'sgrown thick and healthy looking and she's got a bright color. Theglummest, ill-natured little thing she used to be and now her and MasterColin laugh together like a pair of crazy young ones. Perhaps they'regrowing fat on that.""""Perhaps they are,"" said Dr. Craven. ""Let them laugh."""

In the robin's nest there were Eggs and the robin's mate satupon them keeping them warm with her feathery little breast and carefulwings. At first she was very nervous and the robin himself wasindignantly watchful. Even Dickon did not go near the close-grown cornerin those days, but waited until by the quiet working of some mysteriousspell he seemed to have conveyed to the soul of the little pair that inthe garden there was nothing which was not quite likethemselves—nothing which did not understand the wonderfulness of whatwas happening to them—the immense, tender, terrible, heart-breakingbeauty and solemnity of Eggs. If there had been one person in thatgarden who had not known through all his or her innermost being that ifan Egg were taken away or hurt the whole world would whirl round andcrash through space and come to an end—if there had been even one whodid not feel it and act accordingly there could have been no happinesseven in that golden springtime air. But they all knew it and felt it andthe robin and his mate knew they knew it.At first the robin watched Mary and Colin with sharp anxiety. For somemysterious reason he knew he need not watch Dickon. The first moment heset his dew-bright black eye on Dickon he knew he was not a stranger buta sort of robin without beak or feathers. He could speak robin (which isa quite distinct language not to be mistaken for any other). To speakrobin to a robin is like speaking French to a Frenchman. Dickon alwaysspoke it to the robin himself, so the queer gibberish he used when hespoke to humans did not matter in the least. The robin thought he spokethis gibberish to them because they were not intelligent enough tounderstand feathered speech. His movements also were robin. They neverstartled one by being sudden enough to seem dangerous or threatening.Any robin could understand Dickon, so his presence was not evendisturbing.But at the outset it seemed necessary to be on guard against the othertwo. In the first place the boy creature did not come into the garden onhis legs. He was pushed in on a thing with wheels and the skins of wildanimals were thrown over him. That in itself was doubtful. Then when hebegan to stand up and move about he did it in a queer unaccustomed wayand the others seemed to have to help him. The robin used to secretehimself in a bush and watch this anxiously, his head tilted first on oneside and then on the other. He thought that the slow movements mightmean that he was preparing to pounce, as cats do. When cats arepreparing to pounce they creep over the ground very slowly. The robintalked this over with his mate a great deal for a few days but afterthat he decided not to speak of the subject because her terror was sogreat that he was afraid it might be injurious to the Eggs.When the boy began to walk by himself and even to move more quickly itwas an immense relief. But for a long time—or it seemed a long time tothe robin—he was a source of some anxiety. He did not act as the otherhumans did. He seemed very fond of walking but he had a way of sittingor lying down for a while and then getting up in a disconcerting mannerto begin again.One day the robin remembered that when he himself had been made to learnto fly by his parents he had done much the same sort of thing. He hadtaken short flights of a few yards and then had been obliged to rest. Soit occurred to him that this boy was learning to fly—or rather towalk. He mentioned this to his mate and when he told her that the Eggswould probably conduct themselves in the same way after they werefledged she was quite comforted and even became eagerly interested andderived great pleasure from watching the boy over the edge of hernest—though she always thought that the Eggs would be much cleverer andlearn more quickly. But then she said indulgently that humans werealways more clumsy and slow than Eggs and most of them never seemedreally to learn to fly at all. You never met them in the air or ontree-tops.After a while the boy began to move about as the others did, but allthree of the children at times did unusual things. They would standunder the trees and move their arms and legs and heads about in a waywhich was neither walking nor running nor sitting down. They wentthrough these movements at intervals every day and the robin was neverable to explain to his mate what they were doing or trying to do. Hecould only say that he was sure that the Eggs would never flap about insuch a manner; but as the boy who could speak robin so fluently wasdoing the thing with them, birds could be quite sure that the actionswere not of a dangerous nature. Of course neither the robin nor his matehad ever heard of the champion wrestler, Bob Haworth, and his exercisesfor making the muscles stand out like lumps. Robins are not like humanbeings; their muscles are always exercised from the first and so theydevelop themselves in a natural manner. If you have to fly about to findevery meal you eat, your muscles do not become atrophied (atrophiedmeans wasted away through want of use).When the boy was walking and running about and digging and weeding likethe others, the nest in the corner was brooded over by a great peace andcontent. Fears for the Eggs became things of the past. Knowing that yourEggs were as safe as if they were locked in a bank vault and the factthat you could watch so many curious things going on made setting a mostentertaining occupation. On wet days the Eggs' mother sometimes felteven a little dull because the children did not come into the garden.But even on wet days it could not be said that Mary and Colin were dull.One morning when the rain streamed down unceasingly and Colin wasbeginning to feel a little restive, as he was obliged to remain on hissofa because it was not safe to get up and walk about, Mary had aninspiration.""Now that I am a real boy,"" Colin had said, ""my legs and arms and all mybody are so full of Magic that I can't keep them still. They want to bedoing things all the time. Do you know that when I waken in themorning, Mary, when it's quite early and the birds are just shoutingoutside and everything seems just shouting for joy—even the trees andthings we can't really hear—I feel as if I must jump out of bed andshout myself. And if I did it, just think what would happen!""Mary giggled inordinately.""The nurse would come running and Mrs. Medlock would come running andthey would be sure you had gone crazy and they'd send for the doctor,""she said.Colin giggled himself. He could see how they would all look—howhorrified by his outbreak and how amazed to see him standing upright.""I wish my father would come home,"" he said. ""I want to tell him myself.I'm always thinking about it—but we couldn't go on like this muchlonger. I can't stand lying still and pretending, and besides I look toodifferent. I wish it wasn't raining to-day.""It was then Mistress Mary had her inspiration.""Colin,"" she began mysteriously, ""do you know how many rooms there arein this house?""""About a thousand, I suppose,"" he answered.""There's about a hundred no one ever goes into,"" said Mary. ""And onerainy day I went and looked into ever so many of them. No one everknew, though Mrs. Medlock nearly found me out. I lost my way when I wascoming back and I stopped at the end of your corridor. That was thesecond time I heard you crying.""Colin started up on his sofa.""A hundred rooms no one goes into,"" he said. ""It sounds almost like asecret garden. Suppose we go and look at them. You could wheel me in mychair and nobody would know where we went.""""That's what I was thinking,"" said Mary. ""No one would dare to followus. There are galleries where you could run. We could do our exercises.There is a little Indian room where there is a cabinet full of ivoryelephants. There are all sorts of rooms.""""Ring the bell,"" said Colin.When the nurse came in he gave his orders.""I want my chair,"" he said. ""Miss Mary and I are going to look at thepart of the house which is not used. John can push me as far as thepicture-gallery because there are some stairs. Then he must go away andleave us alone until I send for him again.""Rainy days lost their terrors that morning. When the footman had wheeledthe chair into the picture-gallery and left the two together inobedience to orders, Colin and Mary looked at each other delighted. Assoon as Mary had made sure that John was really on his way back to hisown quarters below stairs, Colin got out of his chair.""I am going to run from one end of the gallery to the other,"" he said,""and then I am going to jump and then we will do Bob Haworth'sexercises.""And they did all these things and many others. They looked at theportraits and found the plain little girl dressed in green brocade andholding the parrot on her finger.""All these,"" said Colin, ""must be my relations. They lived a long timeago. That parrot one, I believe, is one of my great, great, great, greataunts. She looks rather like you, Mary—not as you look now but as youlooked when you came here. Now you are a great deal fatter and betterlooking.""""So are you,"" said Mary, and they both laughed.They went to the Indian room and amused themselves with the ivoryelephants. They found the rose-colored brocade boudoir and the hole inthe cushion the mouse had left but the mice had grown up and run awayand the hole was empty. They saw more rooms and made more discoveriesthan Mary had made on her first pilgrimage. They found new corridorsand corners and flights of steps and new old pictures they liked andweird old things they did not know the use of. It was a curiouslyentertaining morning and the feeling of wandering about in the samehouse with other people but at the same time feeling as if one weremiles away from them was a fascinating thing.""I'm glad we came,"" Colin said. ""I never knew I lived in such a bigqueer old place. I like it. We will ramble about every rainy day. Weshall always be finding new queer corners and things.""That morning they had found among other things such good appetites thatwhen they returned to Colin's room it was not possible to send theluncheon away untouched.When the nurse carried the tray down-stairs she slapped it down on thekitchen dresser so that Mrs. Loomis, the cook, could see the highlypolished dishes and plates.""Look at that!"" she said. ""This is a house of mystery, and those twochildren are the greatest mysteries in it.""""If they keep that up every day,"" said the strong young footman John,""there'd be small wonder that he weighs twice as much to-day as he did amonth ago. I should have to give up my place in time, for fear of doingmy muscles an injury.""That afternoon Mary noticed that something new had happened in Colin'sroom. She had noticed it the day before but had said nothing because shethought the change might have been made by chance. She said nothingto-day but she sat and looked fixedly at the picture over the mantel.She could look at it because the curtain had been drawn aside. That wasthe change she noticed.""I know what you want me to tell you,"" said Colin, after she had stareda few minutes. ""I always know when you want me to tell you something.You are wondering why the curtain is drawn back. I am going to keep itlike that.""""Why?"" asked Mary.""Because it doesn't make me angry any more to see her laughing. Iwakened when it was bright moonlight two nights ago and felt as if theMagic was filling the room and making everything so splendid that Icouldn't lie still. I got up and looked out of the window. The room wasquite light and there was a patch of moonlight on the curtain andsomehow that made me go and pull the cord. She looked right down at meas if she were laughing because she was glad I was standing there. Itmade me like to look at her. I want to see her laughing like that allthe time. I think she must have been a sort of Magic person perhaps.""""You are so like her now,"" said Mary, ""that sometimes I think perhapsyou are her ghost made into a boy.""That idea seemed to impress Colin. He thought it over and then answeredher slowly.""If I were her ghost—my father would be fond of me,"" he said.""Do you want him to be fond of you?"" inquired Mary.""I used to hate it because he was not fond of me.

After the morning'sincantations Colin sometimes gave them Magic lectures.""I like to do it,"" he explained, ""because when I grow up and make greatscientific discoveries I shall be obliged to lecture about them and sothis is practise. I can only give short lectures now because I am veryyoung, and besides Ben Weatherstaff would feel as if he was in churchand he would go to sleep.""""Th' best thing about lecturin',"" said Ben, ""is that a chap can get upan' say aught he pleases an' no other chap can answer him back. Iwouldn't be agen' lecturin' a bit mysel' sometimes.""But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes onhim and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection. Itwas not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs whichlooked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which helditself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which hadfilled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light heremembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gazemeant that he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting onand once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him.""What are you thinking about, Ben Weatherstaff?"" he asked.""I was thinkin',"" answered Ben, ""as I'd warrant tha's gone up three orfour pound this week. I was lookin' at tha' calves an' tha' shoulders.I'd like to get thee on a pair o' scales.""""It's the Magic and—and Mrs. Sowerby's buns and milk and things,"" saidColin. ""You see the scientific experiment has succeeded.""That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came hewas ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling thanusual. As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains theyfell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinkingrain. The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for theweeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves whichmust be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold. Colin was asgood at weeding as any one in these days and he could lecture while hewas doing it.""The Magic works best when you work yourself,"" he said this morning.""You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read booksabout bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. Iam making it up now. I keep finding out things.""It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his troweland stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes andthey had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did. Whenhe dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon asif a sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched himself outto his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly. Color glowedin his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness. All at once hehad realized something to the full.""Mary! Dickon!"" he cried. ""Just look at me!""They stopped their weeding and looked at him.""Do you remember that first morning you brought me in here?"" hedemanded.Dickon was looking at him very hard. Being an animal charmer he couldsee more things than most people could and many of them were things henever talked about. He saw some of them now in this boy.""Aye, that we do,"" he answered.Mary looked hard too, but she said nothing.""Just this minute,"" said Colin, ""all at once I remembered itmyself—when I looked at my hand digging with the trowel—and I had tostand up on my feet to see if it was real. And it is real! I'mwell—I'm well!""""Aye, that tha' art!"" said Dickon.""I'm well! I'm well!"" said Colin again, and his face went quite red allover.He had known it before in a way, he had hoped it and felt it and thoughtabout it, but just at that minute something had rushed all throughhim—a sort of rapturous belief and realization and it had been sostrong that he could not help calling out.""I shall live forever and ever and ever!"" he cried grandly. ""I shallfind out thousands and thousands of things. I shall find out aboutpeople and creatures and everything that grows—like Dickon—and I shallnever stop making Magic. I'm well! I'm well! I feel—I feel as if I wantto shout out something—something thankful, joyful!""Ben Weatherstaff, who had been working near a rose-bush, glanced roundat him.""Tha' might sing th' Doxology,"" he suggested in his dryest grunt. He hadno opinion of the Doxology and he did not make the suggestion with anyparticular reverence.But Colin was of an exploring mind and he knew nothing about theDoxology.""What is that?"" he inquired.""Dickon can sing it for thee, I'll warrant,"" replied Ben Weatherstaff.Dickon answered with his all-perceiving animal charmer's smile.""They sing it i' church,"" he said. ""Mother says she believes th'skylarks sings it when they gets up i' th' mornin'.""""If she says that, it must be a nice song,"" Colin answered. "" I've neverbeen in a church myself. I was always too ill. Sing it, Dickon. I wantto hear it.""Dickon was quite simple and unaffected about it. He understood whatColin felt better than Colin did himself. He understood by a sort ofinstinct so natural that he did not know it was understanding. He pulledoff his cap and looked round still smiling.""Tha' must take off tha' cap,"" he said to Colin, ""an' so mun tha',Ben—an' tha' mun stand up, tha' knows.""Colin took off his cap and the sun shone on and warmed his thick hair ashe watched Dickon intently. Ben Weatherstaff scrambled up from hisknees and bared his head too with a sort of puzzled half-resentful lookon his old face as if he didn't know exactly why he was doing thisremarkable thing.Dickon stood out among the trees and rose-bushes and began to sing inquite a simple matter-of-fact way and in a nice strong boy voice:When he had finished, Ben Weatherstaff was standing quite still with hisjaws set obstinately but with a disturbed look in his eyes fixed onColin. Colin's face was thoughtful and appreciative.""It is a very nice song,"" he said. ""I like it. Perhaps it means justwhat I mean when I want to shout out that I am thankful to the Magic.""He stopped and thought in a puzzled way. ""Perhaps they are both the samething. How can we know the exact names of everything? Sing it again,Dickon. Let us try, Mary. I want to sing it, too. It's my song. How doesit begin? 'Praise God from whom all blessings flow'?""And they sang it again, and Mary and Colin lifted their voices asmusically as they could and Dickon's swelled quite loud andbeautiful—and at the second line Ben Weatherstaff raspingly cleared histhroat and at the third he joined in with such vigor that it seemedalmost savage and when the ""Amen"" came to an end Mary observed that thevery same thing had happened to him which had happened when he found outthat Colin was not a cripple—his chin was twitching and he was staringand winking and his leathery old cheeks were wet.""I never seed no sense in th' Doxology afore,"" he said hoarsely, ""but Imay change my mind i' time. I should say tha'd gone up five pound thisweek, Mester Colin—five on 'em!""Colin was looking across the garden at something attracting hisattention and his expression had become a startled one.""Who is coming in here?"" he said quickly. ""Who is it?""The door in the ivied wall had been pushed gently open and a woman hadentered. She had come in with the last line of their song and she hadstood still listening and looking at them. With the ivy behind her, thesunlight drifting through the trees and dappling her long blue cloak,and her nice fresh face smiling across the greenery she was rather likea softly colored illustration in one of Colin's books. She had wonderfulaffectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in—all of them, evenBen Weatherstaff and the ""creatures"" and every flower that was in bloom.Unexpectedly as she had appeared, not one of them felt that she was anintruder at all. Dickon's eyes lighted like lamps.""It's Mother—that's who it is!"" he cried and he went across the grassat a run.Colin began to move toward her, too, and Mary went with him. They bothfelt their pulses beat faster.""It's Mother!"" Dickon said again when they met half-way. ""I knowed tha'wanted to see her an' I told her where th' door was hid.""Colin held out his hand with a sort of flushed royal shyness but hiseyes quite devoured her face.""Even when I was ill I wanted to see you,"" he said, ""you and Dickon andthe secret garden. I'd never wanted to see any one or anything before.""The sight of his uplifted face brought about a sudden change in her own.She flushed and the corners of her mouth shook and a mist seemed tosweep over her eyes.""Eh! dear lad!"" she broke out tremulously. ""Eh! dear lad!"" as if she hadnot known she were going to say it. She did not say, ""Mester Colin,""but just ""dear lad"" quite suddenly. She might have said it to Dickon inthe same way if she had seen something in his face which touched her.Colin liked it.""Are you surprised because I am so well?"" he asked.She put her hand on his shoulder and smiled the mist out of her eyes.""Aye, that I am!"" she said; ""but tha'rt so like thy mother tha' made myheart jump.""""Do you think,"" said Colin a little awkwardly, ""that will make my fatherlike me?""""Aye, for sure, dear lad,"" she answered and she gave his shoulder a softquick pat. ""He mun come home—he mun come home.""""Susan Sowerby,"" said Ben Weatherstaff, getting close to her. ""Look atth' lad's legs, wilt tha'? They was like drumsticks i' stockin' twomonth' ago—an' I heard folk tell as they was bandy an' knock-kneed bothat th' same time. Look at 'em now!""Susan Sowerby laughed a comfortable laugh.""They're goin' to be fine strong lad's legs in a bit,"" she said. ""Lethim go on playin' an' workin' in th' garden an' eatin' hearty an'drinkin' plenty o' good sweet milk an' there'll not be a finer pair i'Yorkshire, thank God for it.""She put both hands on Mistress Mary's shoulders and looked her littleface over in a motherly fashion.""An' thee, too!"" she said. ""Tha'rt grown near as hearty as our 'LizabethEllen. I'll warrant tha'rt like thy mother too. Our Martha told me asMrs. Medlock heard she was a pretty woman. Tha'lt be like a blush rosewhen tha' grows up, my little lass, bless thee.""She did not mention that when Martha came home on her ""day out"" anddescribed the plain sallow child she had said that she had no confidencewhatever in what Mrs. Medlock had heard. ""It doesn't stand to reasonthat a pretty woman could be th' mother o' such a fou' little lass,"" shehad added obstinately.Mary had not had time to pay much attention to her changing face. Shehad only known that she looked ""different"" and seemed to have a greatdeal more hair and that it was growing very fast. But remembering herpleasure in looking at the Mem Sahib in the past she was glad to hearthat she might some day look like her.Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the wholestory of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colinwalked on one side of her and Mary on the other. Each of them keptlooking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about thedelightful feeling she gave them—a sort of warm, supported feeling. Itseemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his ""creatures.""She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they werechildren. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew uponher shoulder as if it were Dickon's. When they told her about the robinand the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly littlemellow laugh in her throat.""I suppose learnin' 'em to fly is like learnin' children to walk, butI'm feared I should be all in a worrit if mine had wings instead o'legs,"" she said.It was because she seemed such a wonderful woman in her nice moorlandcottage way that at last she was told about the Magic.""Do you believe in Magic?"" asked Colin after he had explained aboutIndian fakirs. ""I do hope you do.""""That I do, lad,"" she answered. ""I never knowed it by that name but whatdoes th' name matter? I warrant they call it a different name i' Francean' a different one i' Germany. Th' same thing as set th' seeds swellin'an' th' sun shinin' made thee a well lad an' it's th' Good Thing. Itisn't like us poor fools as think it matters if us is called out of ournames. Th' Big Good Thing doesn't stop to worrit, bless thee. It goeson makin' worlds by th' million—worlds like us. Never thee stopbelievin' in th' Big Good Thing an' knowin' th' world's full of it—an'call it what tha' likes. Tha' wert singin' to it when I come into th'garden.""""I felt so joyful,"" said Colin, opening his beautiful strange eyes ather. ""Suddenly I felt how different I was—how strong my arms and legswere, you know—and how I could dig and stand—and I jumped up andwanted to shout out something to anything that would listen.""""Th' Magic listened when tha' sung th' Doxology. It would ha' listenedto anything tha'd sung. It was th' joy that mattered. Eh! lad,lad—what's names to th' Joy Maker,"" and she gave his shoulders a quicksoft pat again.She had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, andwhen the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hidingplace, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devourtheir food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She wasfull of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. She toldthem stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. She laughedas if she could not help it when they told her of the increasingdifficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretfulinvalid.""You see we can't help laughing nearly all the time when we aretogether,"" explained Colin. ""And it doesn't sound ill at all. We try tochoke it back but it will burst out and that sounds worse than ever.""""There's one thing that comes into my mind so often,"" said Mary, ""and Ican scarcely ever hold in when I think of it suddenly. I keep thinkingsuppose Colin's face should get to look like a full moon. It isn't likeone yet but he gets a tiny bit fatter every day—and suppose somemorning it should look like one—what should we do!""""Bless us all, I can see tha' has a good bit o' play actin' to do,"" saidSusan Sowerby. ""But tha' won't have to keep it up much longer. MesterCraven'll come home.""""Do you think he will?"" asked Colin. ""Why?""Susan Sowerby chuckled softly.""I suppose it 'ud nigh break thy heart if he found out before tha' toldhim in tha' own way,"" she said. ""Tha's laid awake nights plannin' it.""""I couldn't bear any one else to tell him,"" said Colin. ""I think aboutdifferent ways every day. I think now I just want to run into hisroom.""""That'd be a fine start for him,"" said Susan Sowerby. ""I'd like to seehis face, lad. I would that! He mun come back—that he mun.""One of the things they talked of was the visit they were to make to hercottage. They planned it all. They were to drive over the moor and lunchout of doors among the heather. They would see all the twelve childrenand Dickon's garden and would not come back until they were tired.Susan Sowerby got up at last to return to the house and Mrs. Medlock. Itwas time for Colin to be wheeled back also. But before he got into hischair he stood quite close to Susan and fixed his eyes on her with akind of bewildered adoration and he suddenly caught hold of the fold ofher blue cloak and held it fast.""You are just what I—what I wanted,"" he said. ""I wish you were mymother—as well as Dickon's!""All at once Susan Sowerby bent down and drew him with her warm armsclose against the bosom under the blue cloak—as if he had been Dickon'sbrother. The quick mist swept over her eyes.""Eh! dear lad!"" she said. ""Thy own mother's in this 'ere very garden, Ido believe. She couldna' keep out of it. Thy father mun come back tothee—he mun!"""

In the last century more amazing things were found outthan in any century before. In this new century hundreds of things stillmore astounding will be brought to light. At first people refuse tobelieve that a strange new thing can be done, then they begin to hope itcan be done, then they see it can be done—then it is done and all theworld wonders why it was not done centuries ago. One of the new thingspeople began to find out in the last century was that thoughts—justmere thoughts—are as powerful as electric batteries—as good for one assunlight is, or as bad for one as poison. To let a sad thought or a badone get into your mind is as dangerous as letting a scarlet fever germget into your body. If you let it stay there after it has got in you maynever get over it as long as you live.So long as Mistress Mary's mind was full of disagreeable thoughts abouther dislikes and sour opinions of people and her determination not tobe pleased by or interested in anything, she was a yellow-faced, sickly,bored and wretched child. Circumstances, however, were very kind to her,though she was not at all aware of it. They began to push her about forher own good. When her mind gradually filled itself with robins, andmoorland cottages crowded with children, with queer crabbed oldgardeners and common little Yorkshire housemaids, with springtime andwith secret gardens coming alive day by day, and also with a moor boyand his ""creatures,"" there was no room left for the disagreeablethoughts which affected her liver and her digestion and made her yellowand tired.So long as Colin shut himself up in his room and thought only of hisfears and weakness and his detestation of people who looked at him andreflected hourly on humps and early death, he was a hystericalhalf-crazy little hypochondriac who knew nothing of the sunshine and thespring and also did not know that he could get well and could stand uponhis feet if he tried to do it. When new beautiful thoughts began to pushout the old hideous ones, life began to come back to him, his blood ranhealthily through his veins and strength poured into him like a flood.His scientific experiment was quite practical and simple and there wasnothing weird about it at all. Much more surprising things can happen toany one who, when a disagreeable or discouraged thought comes into hismind, just has the sense to remember in time and push it out by puttingin an agreeable determinedly courageous one. Two things cannot be in oneplace.While the secret garden was coming alive and two children were comingalive with it, there was a man wandering about certain far-awaybeautiful places in the Norwegian fiords and the valleys and mountainsof Switzerland and he was a man who for ten years had kept his mindfilled with dark and heart-broken thinking. He had not been courageous;he had never tried to put any other thoughts in the place of the darkones. He had wandered by blue lakes and thought them; he had lain onmountain-sides with sheets of deep blue gentians blooming all about himand flower breaths filling all the air and he had thought them. Aterrible sorrow had fallen upon him when he had been happy and he hadlet his soul fill itself with blackness and had refused obstinately toallow any rift of light to pierce through. He had forgotten and desertedhis home and his duties. When he traveled about, darkness so broodedover him that the sight of him was a wrong done to other people becauseit was as if he poisoned the air about him with gloom. Most strangersthought he must be either half mad or a man with some hidden crime onhis soul. He was a tall man with a drawn face and crooked shoulders andthe name he always entered on hotel registers was, ""Archibald Craven,Misselthwaite Manor, Yorkshire, England.""He had traveled far and wide since the day he saw Mistress Mary in hisstudy and told her she might have her ""bit of earth."" He had been in themost beautiful places in Europe, though he had remained nowhere morethan a few days. He had chosen the quietest and remotest spots. He hadbeen on the tops of mountains whose heads were in the clouds and hadlooked down on other mountains when the sun rose and touched them withsuch light as made it seem as if the world were just being born.But the light had never seemed to touch himself until one day when herealized that for the first time in ten years a strange thing hadhappened. He was in a wonderful valley in the Austrian Tyrol and he hadbeen walking alone through such beauty as might have lifted any man'ssoul out of shadow. He had walked a long way and it had not lifted his.But at last he had felt tired and had thrown himself down to rest on acarpet of moss by a stream. It was a clear little stream which ran quitemerrily along on its narrow way through the luscious damp greenness.Sometimes it made a sound rather like very low laughter as it bubbledover and round stones. He saw birds come and dip their heads to drink init and then flick their wings and fly away. It seemed like a thing aliveand yet its tiny voice made the stillness seem deeper. The valley wasvery, very still.As he sat gazing into the clear running of the water, Archibald Cravengradually felt his mind and body both grow quiet, as quiet as the valleyitself. He wondered if he were going to sleep, but he was not. He satand gazed at the sunlit water and his eyes began to see things growingat its edge. There was one lovely mass of blue forget-me-nots growing soclose to the stream that its leaves were wet and at these he foundhimself looking as he remembered he had looked at such things years ago.He was actually thinking tenderly how lovely it was and what wonders ofblue its hundreds of little blossoms were. He did not know that justthat simple thought was slowly filling his mind—filling and filling ituntil other things were softly pushed aside. It was as if a sweet clearspring had begun to rise in a stagnant pool and had risen and risenuntil at last it swept the dark water away. But of course he did notthink of this himself. He only knew that the valley seemed to growquieter and quieter as he sat and stared at the bright delicateblueness. He did not know how long he sat there or what was happening tohim, but at last he moved as if he were awakening and he got up slowlyand stood on the moss carpet, drawing a long, deep, soft breath andwondering at himself. Something seemed to have been unbound and releasedin him, very quietly.""What is it?"" he said, almost in a whisper, and he passed his hand overhis forehead. ""I almost feel as if—I were alive!""I do not know enough about the wonderfulness of undiscovered things tobe able to explain how this had happened to him. Neither does any oneelse yet. He did not understand at all himself—but he remembered thisstrange hour months afterward when he was at Misselthwaite again and hefound out quite by accident that on this very day Colin had cried out ashe went into the secret garden:""I am going to live forever and ever and ever!""The singular calmness remained with him the rest of the evening and heslept a new reposeful sleep; but it was not with him very long. He didnot know that it could be kept. By the next night he had opened thedoors wide to his dark thoughts and they had come trooping and rushingback. He left the valley and went on his wandering way again. But,strange as it seemed to him, there were minutes—sometimeshalf-hours—when, without his knowing why, the black burden seemed tolift itself again and he knew he was a living man and not a dead one.Slowly—slowly—for no reason that he knew of—he was ""coming alive""with the garden.As the golden summer changed into the deeper golden autumn he went tothe Lake of Como. There he found the loveliness of a dream. He spent hisdays upon the crystal blueness of the lake or he walked back into thesoft thick verdure of the hills and tramped until he was tired so thathe might sleep. But by this time he had begun to sleep better, he knew,and his dreams had ceased to be a terror to him.""Perhaps,"" he thought, ""my body is growing stronger.""It was growing stronger but—because of the rare peaceful hours when histhoughts were changed—his soul was slowly growing stronger, too. Hebegan to think of Misselthwaite and wonder if he should not go home. Nowand then he wondered vaguely about his boy and asked himself what heshould feel when he went and stood by the carved four-posted bed againand looked down at the sharply chiseled ivory-white face while it sleptand the black lashes rimmed so startlingly the close-shut eyes. Heshrank from it.One marvel of a day he had walked so far that when he returned the moonwas high and full and all the world was purple shadow and silver. Thestillness of lake and shore and wood was so wonderful that he did not gointo the villa he lived in. He walked down to a little bowered terraceat the water's edge and sat upon a seat and breathed in all the heavenlyscents of the night. He felt the strange calmness stealing over him andit grew deeper and deeper until he fell asleep.He did not know when he fell asleep and when he began to dream; hisdream was so real that he did not feel as if he were dreaming. Heremembered afterward how intensely wide awake and alert he had thoughthe was. He thought that as he sat and breathed in the scent of the lateroses and listened to the lapping of the water at his feet he heard avoice calling. It was sweet and clear and happy and far away. It seemedvery far, but he heard it as distinctly as if it had been at his veryside.""Archie! Archie! Archie!"" it said, and then again, sweeter and clearerthan before, ""Archie! Archie!""He thought he sprang to his feet not even startled. It was such a realvoice and it seemed so natural that he should hear it.""Lilias! Lilias!"" he answered. ""Lilias! where are you?""""In the garden,"" it came back like a sound from a golden flute. ""In thegarden!""And then the dream ended. But he did not awaken. He slept soundly andsweetly all through the lovely night. When he did awake at last it wasbrilliant morning and a servant was standing staring at him. He was anItalian servant and was accustomed, as all the servants of the villawere, to accepting without question any strange thing his foreign mastermight do. No one ever knew when he would go out or come in or where hewould choose to sleep or if he would roam about the garden or lie in theboat on the lake all night. The man held a salver with some letters onit and he waited quietly until Mr. Craven took them. When he had goneaway Mr. Craven sat a few moments holding them in his hand and lookingat the lake. His strange calm was still upon him and something more—alightness as if the cruel thing which had been done had not happened ashe thought—as if something had changed. He was remembering thedream—the real—real dream.""In the garden!"" he said, wondering at himself. ""In the garden! But thedoor is locked and the key is buried deep.""When he glanced at the letters a few minutes later he saw that the onelying at the top of the rest was an English letter and came fromYorkshire. It was directed in a plain woman's hand but it was not a handhe knew. He opened it, scarcely thinking of the writer, but the firstwords attracted his attention at once.Mr. Craven read the letter twice before he put it back in its envelope.He kept thinking about the dream.""I will go back to Misselthwaite,"" he said. ""Yes, I'll go at once.""And he went through the garden to the villa and ordered Pitcher toprepare for his return to England.In a few days he was in Yorkshire again, and on his long railroadjourney he found himself thinking of his boy as he had never thought inall the ten years past. During those years he had only wished to forgethim. Now, though he did not intend to think about him, memories of himconstantly drifted into his mind. He remembered the black days when hehad raved like a madman because the child was alive and the mother wasdead. He had refused to see it, and when he had gone to look at it atlast it had been such a weak wretched thing that every one had been sureit would die in a few days. But to the surprise of those who took careof it the days passed and it lived and then every one believed it wouldbe a deformed and crippled creature.He had not meant to be a bad father, but he had not felt like a fatherat all. He had supplied doctors and nurses and luxuries, but he hadshrunk from the mere thought of the boy and had buried himself in hisown misery. The first time after a year's absence he returned toMisselthwaite and the small miserable looking thing languidly andindifferently lifted to his face the great gray eyes with black lashesround them, so like and yet so horribly unlike the happy eyes he hadadored, he could not bear the sight of them and turned away pale asdeath. After that he scarcely ever saw him except when he was asleep,and all he knew of him was that he was a confirmed invalid, with avicious, hysterical, half-insane temper. He could only be kept fromfuries dangerous to himself by being given his own way in every detail.All this was not an uplifting thing to recall, but as the train whirledhim through mountain passes and golden plains the man who was ""comingalive"" began to think in a new way and he thought long and steadily anddeeply.""Perhaps I have been all wrong for ten years,"" he said to himself. ""Tenyears is a long time. It may be too late to do anything—quite too late.What have I been thinking of!""Of course this was the wrong Magic—to begin by saying ""too late."" EvenColin could have told him that. But he knew nothing of Magic—eitherblack or white. This he had yet to learn. He wondered if Susan Sowerbyhad taken courage and written to him only because the motherly creaturehad realized that the boy was much worse—was fatally ill. If he had notbeen under the spell of the curious calmness which had taken possessionof him he would have been more wretched than ever. But the calm hadbrought a sort of courage and hope with it. Instead of giving way tothoughts of the worst he actually found he was trying to believe inbetter things.""Could it be possible that she sees that I may be able to do him goodand control him?"" he thought. ""I will go and see her on my way toMisselthwaite.""But when on his way across the moor he stopped the carriage at thecottage, seven or eight children who were playing about gathered in agroup and bobbing seven or eight friendly and polite curtsies told himthat their mother had gone to the other side of the moor early in themorning to help a woman who had a new baby. ""Our Dickon,"" theyvolunteered, was over at the Manor working in one of the gardens wherehe went several days each week.Mr. Craven looked over the collection of sturdy little bodies and roundred-cheeked faces, each one grinning in its own particular way, and heawoke to the fact that they were a healthy likable lot. He smiled attheir friendly grins and took a golden sovereign from his pocket andgave it to ""our 'Lizabeth Ellen"" who was the oldest.""If you divide that into eight parts there will be half a crown for eachof you,"" he said.Then amid grins and chuckles and bobbing of curtsies he drove away,leaving ecstasy and nudging elbows and little jumps of joy behind.The drive across the wonderfulness of the moor was a soothing thing.Why did it seem to give him a sense of home-coming which he had beensure he could never feel again—that sense of the beauty of land and skyand purple bloom of distance and a warming of the heart at drawingnearer to the great old house which had held those of his blood for sixhundred years? How he had driven away from it the last time, shudderingto think of its closed rooms and the boy lying in the four-posted bedwith the brocaded hangings. Was it possible that perhaps he might findhim changed a little for the better and that he might overcome hisshrinking from him? How real that dream had been—how wonderful andclear the voice which called back to him, ""In the garden—In thegarden!""""I will try to find the key,"" he said. ""I will try to open the door. Imust—though I don't know why.""When he arrived at the Manor the servants who received him with theusual ceremony noticed that he looked better and that he did not go tothe remote rooms where he usually lived attended by Pitcher. He wentinto the library and sent for Mrs. Medlock. She came to him somewhatexcited and curious and flustered.""How is Master Colin, Medlock?"" he inquired.""Well, sir,"" Mrs. Medlock answered, ""he's—he's different, in a mannerof speaking.""""Worse?"" he suggested.Mrs. Medlock really was flushed.""Well, you see, sir,"" she tried to explain, ""neither Dr. Craven, nor thenurse, nor me can exactly make him out.""""Why is that?""""To tell the truth, sir, Master Colin might be better and he might bechanging for the worse. His appetite, sir, is past understanding—andhis ways—""""Has he become more—more peculiar?"" her master asked, knitting hisbrows anxiously.""That's it, sir. He's growing very peculiar—when you compare him withwhat he used to be. He used to eat nothing and then suddenly he began toeat something enormous—and then he stopped again all at once and themeals were sent back just as they used to be. You never knew, sir,perhaps, that out of doors he never would let himself be taken. Thethings we've gone through to get him to go out in his chair would leavea body trembling like a leaf. He'd throw himself into such a state thatDr. Craven said he couldn't be responsible for forcing him. Well, sir,just without warning—not long after one of his worst tantrums hesuddenly insisted on being taken out every day by Miss Mary and SusanSowerby's boy Dickon that could push his chair. He took a fancy to bothMiss Mary and Dickon, and Dickon brought his tame animals, and, ifyou'll credit it, sir, out of doors he will stay from morning untilnight.""""How does he look?"" was the next question.""If he took his food natural, sir, you'd think he was putting onflesh—but we're afraid it may be a sort of bloat. He laughs sometimesin a queer way when he's alone with Miss Mary. He never used to laugh atall. Dr. Craven is coming to see you at once, if you'll allow him. Henever was as puzzled in his life.""""Where is Master Colin now?"" Mr. Craven asked.""In the garden, sir. He's always in the garden—though not a humancreature is allowed to go near for fear they'll look at him.""Mr. Craven scarcely heard her last words.""In the garden,"" he said, and after he had sent Mrs. Medlock away hestood and repeated it again and again. ""In the garden!""He had to make an effort to bring himself back to the place he wasstanding in and when he felt he was on earth again he turned and wentout of the room. He took his way, as Mary had done, through the door inthe shrubbery and among the laurels and the fountain beds. The fountainwas playing now and was encircled by beds of brilliant autumn flowers.He crossed the lawn and turned into the Long Walk by the ivied walls. Hedid not walk quickly, but slowly, and his eyes were on the path. He feltas if he were being drawn back to the place he had so long forsaken, andhe did not know why. As he drew near to it his step became still moreslow. He knew where the door was even though the ivy hung thick overit—but he did not know exactly where it lay—that buried key.So he stopped and stood still, looking about him, and almost the momentafter he had paused he started and listened—asking himself if he werewalking in a dream.The ivy hung thick over the door, the key was buried under the shrubs,no human being had passed that portal for ten lonely years—and yetinside the garden there were sounds. They were the sounds of runningscuffling feet seeming to chase round and round under the trees, theywere strange sounds of lowered suppressed voices—exclamations andsmothered joyous cries. It seemed actually like the laughter of youngthings, the uncontrollable laughter of children who were trying not tobe heard but who in a moment or so—as their excitement mounted—wouldburst forth. What in heaven's name was he dreaming of—what in heaven'sname did he hear? Was he losing his reason and thinking he heard thingswhich were not for human ears? Was it that the far clear voice hadmeant?And then the moment came, the uncontrollable moment when the soundsforgot to hush themselves. The feet ran faster and faster—they werenearing the garden door—there was quick strong young breathing and awild outbreak of laughing shouts which could not be contained—and thedoor in the wall was flung wide open, the sheet of ivy swinging back,and a boy burst through it at full speed and, without seeing theoutsider, dashed almost into his arms.Mr. Craven had extended them just in time to save him from falling as aresult of his unseeing dash against him, and when he held him away tolook at him in amazement at his being there he truly gasped for breath.He was a tall boy and a handsome one. He was glowing with life and hisrunning had sent splendid color leaping to his face. He threw the thickhair back from his forehead and lifted a pair of strange gray eyes—eyesfull of boyish laughter and rimmed with black lashes like a fringe. Itwas the eyes which made Mr. Craven gasp for breath.""Who—What? Who!"" he stammered.This was not what Colin had expected—this was not what he had planned.He had never thought of such a meeting. And yet to come dashingout—winning a race—perhaps it was even better. He drew himself up tohis very tallest. Mary, who had been running with him and had dashedthrough the door too, believed that he managed to make himself looktaller than he had ever looked before—inches taller.""Father,"" he said, ""I'm Colin. You can't believe it. I scarcely canmyself. I'm Colin.""Like Mrs. Medlock, he did not understand what his father meant when hesaid hurriedly:""In the garden! In the garden!""""Yes,"" hurried on Colin. ""It was the garden that did it—and Mary andDickon and the creatures—and the Magic. No one knows. We kept it totell you when you came. I'm well, I can beat Mary in a race. I'm goingto be an athlete.""He said it all so like a healthy boy—his face flushed, his wordstumbling over each other in his eagerness—that Mr. Craven's soul shookwith unbelieving joy.Colin put out his hand and laid it on his father's arm.""Aren't you glad, Father?"" he ended.""Aren't you glad? I'm going to live forever and ever and ever!""Mr. Craven put his hands on both the boy's shoulders and held him still.He knew he dared not even try to speak for a moment.""Take me into the garden, my boy,"" he said at last. ""And tell me allabout it.""And so they led him in.The place was a wilderness of autumn gold and purple and violet blue andflaming scarlet and on every side were sheaves of late lilies standingtogether—lilies which were white or white and ruby. He remembered wellwhen the first of them had been planted that just at this season of theyear their late glories should reveal themselves. Late roses climbed andhung and clustered and the sunshine deepening the hue of the yellowingtrees made one feel that one stood in an embowered temple of gold. Thenewcomer stood silent just as the children had done when they came intoits grayness. He looked round and round.""I thought it would be dead,"" he said.""Mary thought so at first,"" said Colin. ""But it came alive.""Then they sat down under their tree—all but Colin, who wanted to standwhile he told the story.It was the strangest thing he had ever heard, Archibald Craven thought,as it was poured forth in headlong boy fashion. Mystery and Magic andwild creatures, the weird midnight meeting—the coming of thespring—the passion of insulted pride which had dragged the young Rajahto his feet to defy old Ben Weatherstaff to his face. The oddcompanionship, the play acting, the great secret so carefully kept. Thelistener laughed until tears came into his eyes and sometimes tears cameinto his eyes when he was not laughing. The Athlete, the Lecturer, theScientific Discoverer was a laughable, lovable, healthy young humanthing.""Now,"" he said at the end of the story, ""it need not be a secret anymore. I dare say it will frighten them nearly into fits when they seeme—but I am never going to get into the chair again. I shall walk backwith you, Father—to the house.""Ben Weatherstaff's duties rarely took him away from the gardens, but onthis occasion he made an excuse to carry some vegetables to the kitchenand being invited into the servants' hall by Mrs. Medlock to drink aglass of beer he was on the spot—as he had hoped to be—when the mostdramatic event Misselthwaite Manor had seen during the presentgeneration actually took place.One of the windows looking upon the courtyard gave also a glimpse of thelawn. Mrs. Medlock, knowing Ben had come from the gardens, hoped that hemight have caught sight of his master and even by chance of his meetingwith Master Colin.""Did you see either of them, Weatherstaff?"" she asked.Ben took his beer-mug from his mouth and wiped his lips with the back ofhis hand.""Aye, that I did,"" he answered with a shrewdly significant air.""Both of them?"" suggested Mrs. Medlock.""Both of 'em,"" returned Ben Weatherstaff. ""Thank ye kindly, ma'am, Icould sup up another mug of it.""""Together?"" said Mrs. Medlock, hastily overfilling his beer-mug in herexcitement.""Together, ma'am,"" and Ben gulped down half of his new mug at one gulp.""Where was Master Colin? How did he look? What did they say to eachother?""""I didna' hear that,"" said Ben, ""along o' only bein' on th' step-ladderlookin' over th' wall. But I'll tell thee this. There's been thingsgoin' on outside as you house people knows nowt about. An' what tha'llfind out tha'll find out soon.""And it was not two minutes before he swallowed the last of his beer andwaved his mug solemnly toward the window which took in through theshrubbery a piece of the lawn.""Look there,"" he said, ""if tha's curious. Look what's comin' across th'grass.""When Mrs. Medlock looked she threw up her hands and gave a little shriekand every man and woman servant within hearing bolted across theservants' hall and stood looking through the window with their eyesalmost starting out of their heads.Across the lawn came the Master of Misselthwaite and he looked as manyof them had never seen him. And by his side with his head up in the airand his eyes full of laughter walked as strongly and steadily as any boyin Yorkshire—Master Colin!"
