They soon know that they will grow up, andthe way Wendy knew was this. One day when she was two years old she was playingin a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. Isuppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her handto her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this forever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, buthenceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two.Two is the beginning of the end.Of course they lived at 14, and until Wendy came her mother was the chief one.She was a lovely lady, with a romantic mind and such a sweet mocking mouth. Herromantic mind was like the tiny boxes, one within the other, that come from thepuzzling East, however many you discover there is always one more; and hersweet mocking mouth had one kiss on it that Wendy could never get, though thereit was, perfectly conspicuous in the right-hand corner.The way Mr. Darling won her was this: the many gentlemen who had been boys whenshe was a girl discovered simultaneously that they loved her, and they all ranto her house to propose to her except Mr. Darling, who took a cab and nipped infirst, and so he got her. He got all of her, except the innermost box and thekiss. He never knew about the box, and in time he gave up trying for the kiss.Wendy thought Napoleon could have got it, but I can picture him trying, andthen going off in a passion, slamming the door.Mr. Darling used to boast to Wendy that her mother not only loved him butrespected him. He was one of those deep ones who know about stocks and shares.Of course no one really knows, but he quite seemed to know, and he often saidstocks were up and shares were down in a way that would have made any womanrespect him.Mrs. Darling was married in white, and at first she kept the books perfectly,almost gleefully, as if it were a game, not so much as a Brussels sprout wasmissing; but by and by whole cauliflowers dropped out, and instead of themthere were pictures of babies without faces. She drew them when she should havebeen totting up. They were Mrs. Darling’s guesses.Wendy came first, then John, then Michael.For a week or two after Wendy came it was doubtful whether they would be ableto keep her, as she was another mouth to feed. Mr. Darling was frightfullyproud of her, but he was very honourable, and he sat on the edge of Mrs.Darling’s bed, holding her hand and calculating expenses, while shelooked at him imploringly. She wanted to risk it, come what might, but that wasnot his way; his way was with a pencil and a piece of paper, and if sheconfused him with suggestions he had to begin at the beginning again.“Now don’t interrupt,” he would beg of her.“I have one pound seventeen here, and two and six at the office; I cancut off my coffee at the office, say ten shillings, making two nine and six,with your eighteen and three makes three nine seven, with five naught naught inmy cheque-book makes eight nine seven—who is that moving?—eightnine seven, dot and carry seven—don’t speak, my own—and thepound you lent to that man who came to the door—quiet, child—dotand carry child—there, you’ve done it!—did I say nine nineseven? yes, I said nine nine seven; the question is, can we try it for a yearon nine nine seven?”“Of course we can, George,” she cried. But she was prejudiced inWendy’s favour, and he was really the grander character of the two.“Remember mumps,” he warned her almost threateningly, and off hewent again. “Mumps one pound, that is what I have put down, but I daresayit will be more like thirty shillings—don’t speak—measles onefive, German measles half a guinea, makes two fifteen six—don’twaggle your finger—whooping-cough, say fifteen shillings”—andso on it went, and it added up differently each time; but at last Wendy justgot through, with mumps reduced to twelve six, and the two kinds of measlestreated as one.There was the same excitement over John, and Michael had even a narrowersqueak; but both were kept, and soon, you might have seen the three of themgoing in a row to Miss Fulsom’s Kindergarten school, accompanied by theirnurse.Mrs. Darling loved to have everything just so, and Mr. Darling had a passionfor being exactly like his neighbours; so, of course, they had a nurse. As theywere poor, owing to the amount of milk the children drank, this nurse was aprim Newfoundland dog, called Nana, who had belonged to no one in particularuntil the Darlings engaged her. She had always thought children important,however, and the Darlings had become acquainted with her in Kensington Gardens,where she spent most of her spare time peeping into perambulators, and was muchhated by careless nursemaids, whom she followed to their homes and complainedof to their mistresses. She proved to be quite a treasure of a nurse. Howthorough she was at bath-time, and up at any moment of the night if one of hercharges made the slightest cry. Of course her kennel was in the nursery. Shehad a genius for knowing when a cough is a thing to have no patience with andwhen it needs stocking around your throat. She believed to her last day inold-fashioned remedies like rhubarb leaf, and made sounds of contempt over allthis new-fangled talk about germs, and so on. It was a lesson in propriety tosee her escorting the children to school, walking sedately by their side whenthey were well behaved, and butting them back into line if they strayed. OnJohn’s footer days she never once forgot his sweater, and she usuallycarried an umbrella in her mouth in case of rain. There is a room in thebasement of Miss Fulsom’s school where the nurses wait. They sat onforms, while Nana lay on the floor, but that was the only difference. Theyaffected to ignore her as of an inferior social status to themselves, and shedespised their light talk. She resented visits to the nursery from Mrs.Darling’s friends, but if they did come she first whipped offMichael’s pinafore and put him into the one with blue braiding, andsmoothed out Wendy and made a dash at John’s hair.No nursery could possibly have been conducted more correctly, and Mr. Darlingknew it, yet he sometimes wondered uneasily whether the neighbours talked.He had his position in the city to consider.Nana also troubled him in another way. He had sometimes a feeling that she didnot admire him. “I know she admires you tremendously, George,” Mrs.Darling would assure him, and then she would sign to the children to bespecially nice to father. Lovely dances followed, in which the only otherservant, Liza, was sometimes allowed to join. Such a midget she looked in herlong skirt and maid’s cap, though she had sworn, when engaged, that shewould never see ten again. The gaiety of those romps! And gayest of all wasMrs. Darling, who would pirouette so wildly that all you could see of her wasthe kiss, and then if you had dashed at her you might have got it. There neverwas a simpler happier family until the coming of Peter Pan.Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’sminds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children areasleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning,repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered duringthe day. If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would seeyour own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watchher. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, Iexpect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where onearth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet,pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedlystowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness andevil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placedat the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread outyour prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind.Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can becomeintensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’smind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There arezigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these areprobably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less anisland, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs andrakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomeswho are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes withsix elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old ladywith a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is alsofirst day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders,hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting intobraces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, andso on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showingthrough, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will standstill.Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had alagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, whileMichael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. Johnlived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy ina house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael hadfriends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on thewhole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in arow you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth.On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles. Wetoo have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shallland no more.Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, notlarge and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure andanother, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs andtable-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before yougo to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darlingfound things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexingwas the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in Johnand Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all overwith him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, andas Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.“Yes, he is rather cocky,” Wendy admitted with regret. Her motherhad been questioning her.“But who is he, my pet?”“He is Peter Pan, you know, mother.”At first Mrs. Darling did not know, but after thinking back into her childhoodshe just remembered a Peter Pan who was said to live with the fairies. Therewere odd stories about him, as that when children died he went part of the waywith them, so that they should not be frightened. She had believed in him atthe time, but now that she was married and full of sense she quite doubtedwhether there was any such person.“Besides,” she said to Wendy, “he would be grown up by thistime.”“Oh no, he isn’t grown up,” Wendy assured her confidently,“and he is just my size.” She meant that he was her size in bothmind and body; she didn’t know how she knew, she just knew it.Mrs. Darling consulted Mr. Darling, but he smiled pooh-pooh. “Mark mywords,” he said, “it is some nonsense Nana has been putting intotheir heads; just the sort of idea a dog would have. Leave it alone, and itwill blow over.”But it would not blow over and soon the troublesome boy gave Mrs. Darling quitea shock.Children have the strangest adventures without being troubled by them. Forinstance, they may remember to mention, a week after the event happened, thatwhen they were in the wood they had met their dead father and had a game withhim. It was in this casual way that Wendy one morning made a disquietingrevelation. Some leaves of a tree had been found on the nursery floor, whichcertainly were not there when the children went to bed, and Mrs. Darling waspuzzling over them when Wendy said with a tolerant smile:“I do believe it is that Peter again!”“Whatever do you mean, Wendy?”“It is so naughty of him not to wipe his feet,” Wendy said,sighing. She was a tidy child.She explained in quite a matter-of-fact way that she thought Peter sometimescame to the nursery in the night and sat on the foot of her bed and played onhis pipes to her. Unfortunately she never woke, so she didn’t know howshe knew, she just knew.“What nonsense you talk, precious. No one can get into the house withoutknocking.”“I think he comes in by the window,” she said.“My love, it is three floors up.”“Were not the leaves at the foot of the window, mother?”It was quite true; the leaves had been found very near the window.Mrs. Darling did not know what to think, for it all seemed so natural to Wendythat you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.“My child,” the mother cried, “why did you not tell me ofthis before?”“I forgot,” said Wendy lightly. She was in a hurry to get herbreakfast.Oh, surely she must have been dreaming.But, on the other hand, there were the leaves. Mrs. Darling examined them verycarefully; they were skeleton leaves, but she was sure they did not come fromany tree that grew in England. She crawled about the floor, peering at it witha candle for marks of a strange foot. She rattled the poker up the chimney andtapped the walls. She let down a tape from the window to the pavement, and itwas a sheer drop of thirty feet, without so much as a spout to climb up by.Certainly Wendy had been dreaming.But Wendy had not been dreaming, as the very next night showed, the night onwhich the extraordinary adventures of these children may be said to have begun.On the night we speak of all the children were once more in bed. It happened tobe Nana’s evening off, and Mrs. Darling had bathed them and sung to themtill one by one they had let go her hand and slid away into the land of sleep.All were looking so safe and cosy that she smiled at her fears now and sat downtranquilly by the fire to sew.It was something for Michael, who on his birthday was getting into shirts. Thefire was warm, however, and the nursery dimly lit by three night-lights, andpresently the sewing lay on Mrs. Darling’s lap. Then her head nodded, oh,so gracefully. She was asleep. Look at the four of them, Wendy and Michael overthere, John here, and Mrs. Darling by the fire. There should have been a fourthnight-light.While she slept she had a dream. She dreamt that the Neverland had come toonear and that a strange boy had broken through from it. He did not alarm her,for she thought she had seen him before in the faces of many women who have nochildren. Perhaps he is to be found in the faces of some mothers also. But inher dream he had rent the film that obscures the Neverland, and she saw Wendyand John and Michael peeping through the gap.The dream by itself would have been a trifle, but while she was dreaming thewindow of the nursery blew open, and a boy did drop on the floor. He wasaccompanied by a strange light, no bigger than your fist, which darted aboutthe room like a living thing and I think it must have been this light thatwakened Mrs. Darling.She started up with a cry, and saw the boy, and somehow she knew at once thathe was Peter Pan. If you or I or Wendy had been there we should have seen thathe was very like Mrs. Darling’s kiss. He was a lovely boy, clad inskeleton leaves and the juices that ooze out of trees but the most entrancingthing about him was that he had all his first teeth. When he saw she was agrown-up, he gnashed the little pearls at her."

She growled and sprang at the boy,who leapt lightly through the window. Again Mrs. Darling screamed, this time indistress for him, for she thought he was killed, and she ran down into thestreet to look for his little body, but it was not there; and she looked up,and in the black night she could see nothing but what she thought was ashooting star.She returned to the nursery, and found Nana with something in her mouth, whichproved to be the boy’s shadow. As he leapt at the window Nana had closedit quickly, too late to catch him, but his shadow had not had time to get out;slam went the window and snapped it off.You may be sure Mrs. Darling examined the shadow carefully, but it was quitethe ordinary kind.Nana had no doubt of what was the best thing to do with this shadow. She hungit out at the window, meaning “He is sure to come back for it; let us putit where he can get it easily without disturbing the children.”But unfortunately Mrs. Darling could not leave it hanging out at the window, itlooked so like the washing and lowered the whole tone of the house. She thoughtof showing it to Mr. Darling, but he was totting up winter great-coats for Johnand Michael, with a wet towel around his head to keep his brain clear, and itseemed a shame to trouble him; besides, she knew exactly what he would say:“It all comes of having a dog for a nurse.”She decided to roll the shadow up and put it away carefully in a drawer, untila fitting opportunity came for telling her husband. Ah me!The opportunity came a week later, on that never-to-be-forgotten Friday. Ofcourse it was a Friday.“I ought to have been specially careful on a Friday,” she used tosay afterwards to her husband, while perhaps Nana was on the other side of her,holding her hand.“No, no,” Mr. Darling always said, “I am responsible for itall. I, George Darling, did it. Mea culpa, mea culpa.” He had hada classical education.They sat thus night after night recalling that fatal Friday, till every detailof it was stamped on their brains and came through on the other side like thefaces on a bad coinage.“If only I had not accepted that invitation to dine at 27,” Mrs.Darling said.“If only I had not poured my medicine into Nana’s bowl,” saidMr. Darling.“If only I had pretended to like the medicine,” was whatNana’s wet eyes said.“My liking for parties, George.”“My fatal gift of humour, dearest.”“My touchiness about trifles, dear master and mistress.”Then one or more of them would break down altogether; Nana at the thought,“It’s true, it’s true, they ought not to have had a dog for anurse.” Many a time it was Mr. Darling who put the handkerchief toNana’s eyes.“That fiend!” Mr. Darling would cry, and Nana’s bark was theecho of it, but Mrs. Darling never upbraided Peter; there was something in theright-hand corner of her mouth that wanted her not to call Peter names.They would sit there in the empty nursery, recalling fondly every smallestdetail of that dreadful evening. It had begun so uneventfully, so preciselylike a hundred other evenings, with Nana putting on the water forMichael’s bath and carrying him to it on her back.“I won’t go to bed,” he had shouted, like one who stillbelieved that he had the last word on the subject, “I won’t, Iwon’t. Nana, it isn’t six o’clock yet. Oh dear, oh dear, Ishan’t love you any more, Nana. I tell you I won’t be bathed, Iwon’t, I won’t!”Then Mrs. Darling had come in, wearing her white evening-gown. She had dressedearly because Wendy so loved to see her in her evening-gown, with the necklaceGeorge had given her. She was wearing Wendy’s bracelet on her arm; shehad asked for the loan of it. Wendy loved to lend her bracelet to her mother.She had found her two older children playing at being herself and father on theoccasion of Wendy’s birth, and John was saying:“I am happy to inform you, Mrs. Darling, that you are now amother,” in just such a tone as Mr. Darling himself may have used on thereal occasion.Wendy had danced with joy, just as the real Mrs. Darling must have done.Then John was born, with the extra pomp that he conceived due to the birth of amale, and Michael came from his bath to ask to be born also, but John saidbrutally that they did not want any more.Michael had nearly cried. “Nobody wants me,” he said, and of coursethe lady in the evening-dress could not stand that.“I do,” she said, “I so want a third child.”“Boy or girl?” asked Michael, not too hopefully.“Boy.”Then he had leapt into her arms. Such a little thing for Mr. and Mrs. Darlingand Nana to recall now, but not so little if that was to be Michael’slast night in the nursery.They go on with their recollections.“It was then that I rushed in like a tornado, wasn’t it?” Mr.Darling would say, scorning himself; and indeed he had been like a tornado.Perhaps there was some excuse for him. He, too, had been dressing for theparty, and all had gone well with him until he came to his tie. It is anastounding thing to have to tell, but this man, though he knew about stocks andshares, had no real mastery of his tie. Sometimes the thing yielded to himwithout a contest, but there were occasions when it would have been better forthe house if he had swallowed his pride and used a made-up tie.This was such an occasion. He came rushing into the nursery with the crumpledlittle brute of a tie in his hand.“Why, what is the matter, father dear?”“Matter!” he yelled; he really yelled. “This tie, it will nottie.” He became dangerously sarcastic. “Not round my neck! Roundthe bed-post! Oh yes, twenty times have I made it up round the bed-post, butround my neck, no! Oh dear no! begs to be excused!”He thought Mrs. Darling was not sufficiently impressed, and he went on sternly,“I warn you of this, mother, that unless this tie is round my neck wedon’t go out to dinner to-night, and if I don’t go out to dinnerto-night, I never go to the office again, and if I don’t go to the officeagain, you and I starve, and our children will be flung into thestreets.”Even then Mrs. Darling was placid. “Let me try, dear,” she said,and indeed that was what he had come to ask her to do, and with her nice coolhands she tied his tie for him, while the children stood around to see theirfate decided. Some men would have resented her being able to do it so easily,but Mr. Darling had far too fine a nature for that; he thanked her carelessly,at once forgot his rage, and in another moment was dancing round the room withMichael on his back.“How wildly we romped!” says Mrs. Darling now, recalling it.“Our last romp!” Mr. Darling groaned.“O George, do you remember Michael suddenly said to me, ‘How didyou get to know me, mother?’”“I remember!”“They were rather sweet, don’t you think, George?”“And they were ours, ours! and now they are gone.”The romp had ended with the appearance of Nana, and most unluckily Mr. Darlingcollided against her, covering his trousers with hairs. They were not only newtrousers, but they were the first he had ever had with braid on them, and hehad had to bite his lip to prevent the tears coming. Of course Mrs. Darlingbrushed him, but he began to talk again about its being a mistake to have a dogfor a nurse.“George, Nana is a treasure.”“No doubt, but I have an uneasy feeling at times that she looks upon thechildren as puppies.”“Oh no, dear one, I feel sure she knows they have souls.”“I wonder,” Mr. Darling said thoughtfully, “I wonder.”It was an opportunity, his wife felt, for telling him about the boy. At firsthe pooh-poohed the story, but he became thoughtful when she showed him theshadow.“It is nobody I know,” he said, examining it carefully, “butit does look a scoundrel.”“We were still discussing it, you remember,” says Mr. Darling,“when Nana came in with Michael’s medicine. You will never carrythe bottle in your mouth again, Nana, and it is all my fault.”Strong man though he was, there is no doubt that he had behaved ratherfoolishly over the medicine. If he had a weakness, it was for thinking that allhis life he had taken medicine boldly, and so now, when Michael dodged thespoon in Nana’s mouth, he had said reprovingly, “Be a man,Michael.”“Won’t; won’t!” Michael cried naughtily. Mrs. Darlingleft the room to get a chocolate for him, and Mr. Darling thought this showedwant of firmness.“Mother, don’t pamper him,” he called after her.“Michael, when I was your age I took medicine without a murmur. I said,‘Thank you, kind parents, for giving me bottles to make mewell.’”He really thought this was true, and Wendy, who was now in her night-gown,believed it also, and she said, to encourage Michael, “That medicine yousometimes take, father, is much nastier, isn’t it?”“Ever so much nastier,” Mr. Darling said bravely, “and Iwould take it now as an example to you, Michael, if I hadn’t lost thebottle.”He had not exactly lost it; he had climbed in the dead of night to the top ofthe wardrobe and hidden it there. What he did not know was that the faithfulLiza had found it, and put it back on his wash-stand.“I know where it is, father,” Wendy cried, always glad to be ofservice. “I’ll bring it,” and she was off before he couldstop her. Immediately his spirits sank in the strangest way.“John,” he said, shuddering, “it’s most beastly stuff.It’s that nasty, sticky, sweet kind.”“It will soon be over, father,” John said cheerily, and then inrushed Wendy with the medicine in a glass.“I have been as quick as I could,” she panted.“You have been wonderfully quick,” her father retorted, with avindictive politeness that was quite thrown away upon her. “Michaelfirst,” he said doggedly.“Father first,” said Michael, who was of a suspicious nature.“I shall be sick, you know,” Mr. Darling said threateningly.“Come on, father,” said John.“Hold your tongue, John,” his father rapped out.Wendy was quite puzzled. “I thought you took it quite easily,father.”“That is not the point,” he retorted. “The point is, thatthere is more in my glass than in Michael’s spoon.” His proud heartwas nearly bursting. “And it isn’t fair: I would say it though itwere with my last breath; it isn’t fair.”“Father, I am waiting,” said Michael coldly.“It’s all very well to say you are waiting; so am I waiting.”“Father’s a cowardly custard.”“So are you a cowardly custard.”“I’m not frightened.”“Neither am I frightened.”“Well, then, take it.”“Well, then, you take it.”Wendy had a splendid idea. “Why not both take it at the same time?”“Certainly,” said Mr. Darling. “Are you ready,Michael?”Wendy gave the words, one, two, three, and Michael took his medicine, but Mr.Darling slipped his behind his back.There was a yell of rage from Michael, and “O father!” Wendyexclaimed.“What do you mean by ‘O father’?” Mr. Darling demanded.“Stop that row, Michael. I meant to take mine, but I—I missedit.”It was dreadful the way all the three were looking at him, just as if they didnot admire him. “Look here, all of you,” he said entreatingly, assoon as Nana had gone into the bathroom. “I have just thought of asplendid joke. I shall pour my medicine into Nana’s bowl, and she willdrink it, thinking it is milk!”It was the colour of milk; but the children did not have their father’ssense of humour, and they looked at him reproachfully as he poured the medicineinto Nana’s bowl. “What fun!” he said doubtfully, and theydid not dare expose him when Mrs. Darling and Nana returned.“Nana, good dog,” he said, patting her, “I have put a littlemilk into your bowl, Nana.”Nana wagged her tail, ran to the medicine, and began lapping it. Then she gaveMr. Darling such a look, not an angry look: she showed him the great red tearthat makes us so sorry for noble dogs, and crept into her kennel.Mr. Darling was frightfully ashamed of himself, but he would not give in. In ahorrid silence Mrs. Darling smelt the bowl. “O George,” she said,“it’s your medicine!”“It was only a joke,” he roared, while she comforted her boys, andWendy hugged Nana. “Much good,” he said bitterly, “my wearingmyself to the bone trying to be funny in this house.”And still Wendy hugged Nana. “That’s right,” he shouted.“Coddle her! Nobody coddles me. Oh dear no! I am only the breadwinner,why should I be coddled—why, why, why!”“George,” Mrs. Darling entreated him, “not so loud; theservants will hear you.” Somehow they had got into the way of callingLiza the servants.“Let them!” he answered recklessly. “Bring in the wholeworld. But I refuse to allow that dog to lord it in my nursery for an hourlonger.”The children wept, and Nana ran to him beseechingly, but he waved her back. Hefelt he was a strong man again. “In vain, in vain,” he cried;“the proper place for you is the yard, and there you go to be tied upthis instant.”“George, George,” Mrs. Darling whispered, “remember what Itold you about that boy.”Alas, he would not listen. He was determined to show who was master in thathouse, and when commands would not draw Nana from the kennel, he lured her outof it with honeyed words, and seizing her roughly, dragged her from thenursery. He was ashamed of himself, and yet he did it. It was all owing to histoo affectionate nature, which craved for admiration. When he had tied her upin the back-yard, the wretched father went and sat in the passage, with hisknuckles to his eyes.In the meantime Mrs. Darling had put the children to bed in unwonted silenceand lit their night-lights. They could hear Nana barking, and John whimpered,“It is because he is chaining her up in the yard,” but Wendy waswiser.“That is not Nana’s unhappy bark,” she said, little guessingwhat was about to happen; “that is her bark when she smellsdanger.”Danger!“Are you sure, Wendy?”“Oh, yes.”Mrs. Darling quivered and went to the window. It was securely fastened. Shelooked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round thehouse, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did notnotice this, nor that one or two of the smaller ones winked at her. Yet anameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, “Oh, how I wishthat I wasn’t going to a party to-night!”Even Michael, already half asleep, knew that she was perturbed, and he asked,“Can anything harm us, mother, after the night-lights are lit?”“Nothing, precious,” she said; “they are the eyes a motherleaves behind her to guard her children.”She went from bed to bed singing enchantments over them, and little Michaelflung his arms round her. “Mother,” he cried, “I’m gladof you.” They were the last words she was to hear from him for a longtime.No. 27 was only a few yards distant, but there had been a slight fall of snow,and Father and Mother Darling picked their way over it deftly not to soil theirshoes. They were already the only persons in the street, and all the stars werewatching them. Stars are beautiful, but they may not take an active part inanything, they must just look on for ever. It is a punishment put on them forsomething they did so long ago that no star now knows what it was. So the olderones have become glassy-eyed and seldom speak (winking is the star language),but the little ones still wonder. They are not really friendly to Peter, whohad a mischievous way of stealing up behind them and trying to blow them out;but they are so fond of fun that they were on his side to-night, and anxious toget the grown-ups out of the way. So as soon as the door of 27 closed on Mr.and Mrs. Darling there was a commotion in the firmament, and the smallest ofall the stars in the Milky Way screamed out:“Now, Peter!”"

They were awfully nicelittle night-lights, and one cannot help wishing that they could have keptawake to see Peter; but Wendy’s light blinked and gave such a yawn thatthe other two yawned also, and before they could close their mouths all thethree went out.There was another light in the room now, a thousand times brighter than thenight-lights, and in the time we have taken to say this, it had been in all thedrawers in the nursery, looking for Peter’s shadow, rummaged the wardrobeand turned every pocket inside out. It was not really a light; it made thislight by flashing about so quickly, but when it came to rest for a second yousaw it was a fairy, no longer than your hand, but still growing. It was a girlcalled Tinker Bell exquisitely gowned in a skeleton leaf, cut low and square,through which her figure could be seen to the best advantage. She was slightlyinclined to embonpoint.A moment after the fairy’s entrance the window was blown open by thebreathing of the little stars, and Peter dropped in. He had carried Tinker Bellpart of the way, and his hand was still messy with the fairy dust.“Tinker Bell,” he called softly, after making sure that thechildren were asleep, “Tink, where are you?” She was in a jug forthe moment, and liking it extremely; she had never been in a jug before.“Oh, do come out of that jug, and tell me, do you know where they put myshadow?”The loveliest tinkle as of golden bells answered him. It is the fairy language.You ordinary children can never hear it, but if you were to hear it you wouldknow that you had heard it once before.Tink said that the shadow was in the big box. She meant the chest of drawers,and Peter jumped at the drawers, scattering their contents to the floor withboth hands, as kings toss ha’pence to the crowd. In a moment he hadrecovered his shadow, and in his delight he forgot that he had shut Tinker Bellup in the drawer.If he thought at all, but I don’t believe he ever thought, it was that heand his shadow, when brought near each other, would join like drops of water,and when they did not he was appalled. He tried to stick it on with soap fromthe bathroom, but that also failed. A shudder passed through Peter, and he saton the floor and cried.His sobs woke Wendy, and she sat up in bed. She was not alarmed to see astranger crying on the nursery floor; she was only pleasantly interested.“Boy,” she said courteously, “why are you crying?”Peter could be exceeding polite also, having learned the grand manner at fairyceremonies, and he rose and bowed to her beautifully. She was much pleased, andbowed beautifully to him from the bed.“What’s your name?” he asked.“Wendy Moira Angela Darling,” she replied with some satisfaction.“What is your name?”“Peter Pan.”She was already sure that he must be Peter, but it did seem a comparativelyshort name.“Is that all?”“Yes,” he said rather sharply. He felt for the first time that itwas a shortish name.“I’m so sorry,” said Wendy Moira Angela.“It doesn’t matter,” Peter gulped.She asked where he lived.“Second to the right,” said Peter, “and then straight on tillmorning.”“What a funny address!”Peter had a sinking. For the first time he felt that perhaps it was a funnyaddress.“No, it isn’t,” he said.“I mean,” Wendy said nicely, remembering that she was hostess,“is that what they put on the letters?”He wished she had not mentioned letters.“Don’t get any letters,” he said contemptuously.“But your mother gets letters?”“Don’t have a mother,” he said. Not only had he no mother,but he had not the slightest desire to have one. He thought them veryover-rated persons. Wendy, however, felt at once that she was in the presenceof a tragedy.“O Peter, no wonder you were crying,” she said, and got out of bedand ran to him.“I wasn’t crying about mothers,” he said rather indignantly.“I was crying because I can’t get my shadow to stick on. Besides, Iwasn’t crying.”“It has come off?”“Yes.”Then Wendy saw the shadow on the floor, looking so draggled, and she wasfrightfully sorry for Peter. “How awful!” she said, but she couldnot help smiling when she saw that he had been trying to stick it on with soap.How exactly like a boy!Fortunately she knew at once what to do. “It must be sewn on,” shesaid, just a little patronisingly.“What’s sewn?” he asked.“You’re dreadfully ignorant.”“No, I’m not.”But she was exulting in his ignorance. “I shall sew it on for you, mylittle man,” she said, though he was tall as herself, and she got out herhousewife, and sewed the shadow on to Peter’s foot.“I daresay it will hurt a little,” she warned him.“Oh, I shan’t cry,” said Peter, who was already of theopinion that he had never cried in his life. And he clenched his teeth and didnot cry, and soon his shadow was behaving properly, though still a littlecreased.“Perhaps I should have ironed it,” Wendy said thoughtfully, butPeter, boylike, was indifferent to appearances, and he was now jumping about inthe wildest glee. Alas, he had already forgotten that he owed his bliss toWendy. He thought he had attached the shadow himself. “How clever Iam!” he crowed rapturously, “oh, the cleverness of me!”It is humiliating to have to confess that this conceit of Peter was one of hismost fascinating qualities. To put it with brutal frankness, there never was acockier boy.But for the moment Wendy was shocked. “You conceit,” she exclaimed,with frightful sarcasm; “of course I did nothing!”“You did a little,” Peter said carelessly, and continued to dance.“A little!” she replied with hauteur; “if I am no use I canat least withdraw,” and she sprang in the most dignified way into bed andcovered her face with the blankets.To induce her to look up he pretended to be going away, and when this failed hesat on the end of the bed and tapped her gently with his foot.“Wendy,” he said, “don’t withdraw. I can’t helpcrowing, Wendy, when I’m pleased with myself.” Still she would notlook up, though she was listening eagerly. “Wendy,” he continued,in a voice that no woman has ever yet been able to resist, “Wendy, onegirl is more use than twenty boys.”Now Wendy was every inch a woman, though there were not very many inches, andshe peeped out of the bed-clothes.“Do you really think so, Peter?”“Yes, I do.”“I think it’s perfectly sweet of you,” she declared,“and I’ll get up again,” and she sat with him on the side ofthe bed. She also said she would give him a kiss if he liked, but Peter did notknow what she meant, and he held out his hand expectantly.“Surely you know what a kiss is?” she asked, aghast.“I shall know when you give it to me,” he replied stiffly, and notto hurt his feeling she gave him a thimble.“Now,” said he, “shall I give you a kiss?” and shereplied with a slight primness, “If you please.” She made herselfrather cheap by inclining her face toward him, but he merely dropped an acornbutton into her hand, so she slowly returned her face to where it had beenbefore, and said nicely that she would wear his kiss on the chain around herneck. It was lucky that she did put it on that chain, for it was afterwards tosave her life.When people in our set are introduced, it is customary for them to ask eachother’s age, and so Wendy, who always liked to do the correct thing,asked Peter how old he was. It was not really a happy question to ask him; itwas like an examination paper that asks grammar, when what you want to be askedis Kings of England.“I don’t know,” he replied uneasily, “but I am quiteyoung.” He really knew nothing about it, he had merely suspicions, but hesaid at a venture, “Wendy, I ran away the day I was born.”Wendy was quite surprised, but interested; and she indicated in the charmingdrawing-room manner, by a touch on her night-gown, that he could sit nearerher.“It was because I heard father and mother,” he explained in a lowvoice, “talking about what I was to be when I became a man.” He wasextraordinarily agitated now. “I don’t want ever to be aman,” he said with passion. “I want always to be a little boy andto have fun. So I ran away to Kensington Gardens and lived a long long timeamong the fairies.”She gave him a look of the most intense admiration, and he thought it wasbecause he had run away, but it was really because he knew fairies. Wendy hadlived such a home life that to know fairies struck her as quite delightful. Shepoured out questions about them, to his surprise, for they were rather anuisance to him, getting in his way and so on, and indeed he sometimes had togive them a hiding. Still, he liked them on the whole, and he told her aboutthe beginning of fairies.“You see, Wendy, when the first baby laughed for the first time, itslaugh broke into a thousand pieces, and they all went skipping about, and thatwas the beginning of fairies.”Tedious talk this, but being a stay-at-home she liked it.“And so,” he went on good-naturedly, “there ought to be onefairy for every boy and girl.”“Ought to be? Isn’t there?”“No. You see children know such a lot now, they soon don’t believein fairies, and every time a child says, ‘I don’t believe infairies,’ there is a fairy somewhere that falls down dead.”Really, he thought they had now talked enough about fairies, and it struck himthat Tinker Bell was keeping very quiet. “I can’t think where shehas gone to,” he said, rising, and he called Tink by name. Wendy’sheart went flutter with a sudden thrill.“Peter,” she cried, clutching him, “you don’t mean totell me that there is a fairy in this room!”“She was here just now,” he said a little impatiently. “Youdon’t hear her, do you?” and they both listened.“The only sound I hear,” said Wendy, “is like a tinkle ofbells.”“Well, that’s Tink, that’s the fairy language. I think I hearher too.”The sound came from the chest of drawers, and Peter made a merry face. No onecould ever look quite so merry as Peter, and the loveliest of gurgles was hislaugh. He had his first laugh still.“Wendy,” he whispered gleefully, “I do believe I shut her upin the drawer!”He let poor Tink out of the drawer, and she flew about the nursery screamingwith fury. “You shouldn’t say such things,” Peter retorted.“Of course I’m very sorry, but how could I know you were in thedrawer?”Wendy was not listening to him. “O Peter,” she cried, “if shewould only stand still and let me see her!”“They hardly ever stand still,” he said, but for one moment Wendysaw the romantic figure come to rest on the cuckoo clock. “O thelovely!” she cried, though Tink’s face was still distorted withpassion.“Tink,” said Peter amiably, “this lady says she wishes youwere her fairy.”Tinker Bell answered insolently.“What does she say, Peter?”He had to translate. “She is not very polite. She says you are a greatugly girl, and that she is my fairy.”He tried to argue with Tink. “You know you can’t be my fairy, Tink,because I am an gentleman and you are a lady.”To this Tink replied in these words, “You silly ass,” anddisappeared into the bathroom. “She is quite a common fairy,” Peterexplained apologetically, “she is called Tinker Bell because she mendsthe pots and kettles.”They were together in the armchair by this time, and Wendy plied him with morequestions.“If you don’t live in Kensington Gardens now—”“Sometimes I do still.”“But where do you live mostly now?”“With the lost boys.”“Who are they?”“They are the children who fall out of their perambulators when the nurseis looking the other way. If they are not claimed in seven days they are sentfar away to the Neverland to defray expenses. I’m captain.”“What fun it must be!”“Yes,” said cunning Peter, “but we are rather lonely. You seewe have no female companionship.”“Are none of the others girls?”“Oh, no; girls, you know, are much too clever to fall out of theirprams.”This flattered Wendy immensely. “I think,” she said, “it isperfectly lovely the way you talk about girls; John there just despisesus.”For reply Peter rose and kicked John out of bed, blankets and all; one kick.This seemed to Wendy rather forward for a first meeting, and she told him withspirit that he was not captain in her house. However, John continued to sleepso placidly on the floor that she allowed him to remain there. “And Iknow you meant to be kind,” she said, relenting, “so you may giveme a kiss.”For the moment she had forgotten his ignorance about kisses. “I thoughtyou would want it back,” he said a little bitterly, and offered to returnher the thimble.“Oh dear,” said the nice Wendy, “I don’t mean a kiss, Imean a thimble.”“What’s that?”“It’s like this.” She kissed him.“Funny!” said Peter gravely. “Now shall I give you athimble?”“If you wish to,” said Wendy, keeping her head erect this time.Peter thimbled her, and almost immediately she screeched. “What is it,Wendy?”“It was exactly as if someone were pulling my hair.”“That must have been Tink. I never knew her so naughty before.”And indeed Tink was darting about again, using offensive language.“She says she will do that to you, Wendy, every time I give you athimble.”“But why?”“Why, Tink?”Again Tink replied, “You silly ass.” Peter could not understandwhy, but Wendy understood, and she was just slightly disappointed when headmitted that he came to the nursery window not to see her but to listen tostories.“You see, I don’t know any stories. None of the lost boys knows anystories.”“How perfectly awful,” Wendy said.“Do you know,” Peter asked “why swallows build in the eavesof houses? It is to listen to the stories. O Wendy, your mother was telling yousuch a lovely story.”“Which story was it?”“About the prince who couldn’t find the lady who wore the glassslipper.”“Peter,” said Wendy excitedly, “that was Cinderella, and hefound her, and they lived happily ever after.”Peter was so glad that he rose from the floor, where they had been sitting, andhurried to the window.“Where are you going?” she cried with misgiving.“To tell the other boys.”“Don’t go Peter,” she entreated, “I know such lots ofstories.”Those were her precise words, so there can be no denying that it was she whofirst tempted him.He came back, and there was a greedy look in his eyes now which ought to havealarmed her, but did not.“Oh, the stories I could tell to the boys!” she cried, and thenPeter gripped her and began to draw her toward the window.“Let me go!” she ordered him.“Wendy, do come with me and tell the other boys.”Of course she was very pleased to be asked, but she said, “Oh dear, Ican’t. Think of mummy! Besides, I can’t fly.”“I’ll teach you.”“Oh, how lovely to fly.”“I’ll teach you how to jump on the wind’s back, and then awaywe go.”“Oo!” she exclaimed rapturously.“Wendy, Wendy, when you are sleeping in your silly bed you might beflying about with me saying funny things to the stars.”“Oo!”“And, Wendy, there are mermaids.”“Mermaids! With tails?”“Such long tails.”“Oh,” cried Wendy, “to see a mermaid!”He had become frightfully cunning. “Wendy,” he said, “how weshould all respect you.”She was wriggling her body in distress. It was quite as if she were trying toremain on the nursery floor.But he had no pity for her.“Wendy,” he said, the sly one, “you could tuck us in atnight.”“Oo!”“None of us has ever been tucked in at night.”“Oo,” and her arms went out to him.“And you could darn our clothes, and make pockets for us. None of us hasany pockets.”How could she resist. “Of course it’s awfully fascinating!”she cried. “Peter, would you teach John and Michael to fly too?”“If you like,” he said indifferently, and she ran to John andMichael and shook them. “Wake up,” she cried, “Peter Pan hascome and he is to teach us to fly.”John rubbed his eyes. “Then I shall get up,” he said. Of course hewas on the floor already. “Hallo,” he said, “I am up!”Michael was up by this time also, looking as sharp as a knife with six bladesand a saw, but Peter suddenly signed silence. Their faces assumed the awfulcraftiness of children listening for sounds from the grown-up world. All was asstill as salt. Then everything was right. No, stop! Everything was wrong. Nana,who had been barking distressfully all the evening, was quiet now. It was hersilence they had heard.“Out with the light! Hide! Quick!” cried John, taking command forthe only time throughout the whole adventure. And thus when Liza entered,holding Nana, the nursery seemed quite its old self, very dark, and you wouldhave sworn you heard its three wicked inmates breathing angelically as theyslept. They were really doing it artfully from behind the window curtains.Liza was in a bad temper, for she was mixing the Christmas puddings in thekitchen, and had been drawn from them, with a raisin still on her cheek, byNana’s absurd suspicions. She thought the best way of getting a littlequiet was to take Nana to the nursery for a moment, but in custody of course.“There, you suspicious brute,” she said, not sorry that Nana was indisgrace. “They are perfectly safe, aren’t they? Every one of thelittle angels sound asleep in bed. Listen to their gentle breathing.”Here Michael, encouraged by his success, breathed so loudly that they werenearly detected. Nana knew that kind of breathing, and she tried to dragherself out of Liza’s clutches.But Liza was dense. “No more of it, Nana,” she said sternly,pulling her out of the room. “I warn you if you bark again I shall gostraight for master and missus and bring them home from the party, and then,oh, won’t master whip you, just.”She tied the unhappy dog up again, but do you think Nana ceased to bark? Bringmaster and missus home from the party! Why, that was just what she wanted. Doyou think she cared whether she was whipped so long as her charges were safe?Unfortunately Liza returned to her puddings, and Nana, seeing that no helpwould come from her, strained and strained at the chain until at last she brokeit. In another moment she had burst into the dining-room of 27 and flung up herpaws to heaven, her most expressive way of making a communication. Mr. and Mrs.Darling knew at once that something terrible was happening in their nursery,and without a good-bye to their hostess they rushed into the street.But it was now ten minutes since three scoundrels had been breathing behind thecurtains, and Peter Pan can do a great deal in ten minutes.We now return to the nursery.“It’s all right,” John announced, emerging from hishiding-place. “I say, Peter, can you really fly?”Instead of troubling to answer him Peter flew around the room, taking themantelpiece on the way.“How topping!” said John and Michael.“How sweet!” cried Wendy.“Yes, I’m sweet, oh, I am sweet!” said Peter, forgetting hismanners again.It looked delightfully easy, and they tried it first from the floor and thenfrom the beds, but they always went down instead of up.“I say, how do you do it?” asked John, rubbing his knee. He wasquite a practical boy.“You just think lovely wonderful thoughts,” Peter explained,“and they lift you up in the air.”He showed them again.“You’re so nippy at it,” John said, “couldn’t youdo it very slowly once?”Peter did it both slowly and quickly. “I’ve got it now,Wendy!” cried John, but soon he found he had not. Not one of them couldfly an inch, though even Michael was in words of two syllables, and Peter didnot know A from Z.Of course Peter had been trifling with them, for no one can fly unless thefairy dust has been blown on him. Fortunately, as we have mentioned, one of hishands was messy with it, and he blew some on each of them, with the most superbresults.“Now just wiggle your shoulders this way,” he said, “and letgo.”They were all on their beds, and gallant Michael let go first. He did not quitemean to let go, but he did it, and immediately he was borne across the room.“I flewed!” he screamed while still in mid-air.John let go and met Wendy near the bathroom.“Oh, lovely!”“Oh, ripping!”“Look at me!”“Look at me!”“Look at me!”They were not nearly so elegant as Peter, they could not help kicking a little,but their heads were bobbing against the ceiling, and there is almost nothingso delicious as that. Peter gave Wendy a hand at first, but had to desist, Tinkwas so indignant.Up and down they went, and round and round. Heavenly was Wendy’s word.“I say,” cried John, “why shouldn’t we all goout?”Of course it was to this that Peter had been luring them.Michael was ready: he wanted to see how long it took him to do a billion miles.But Wendy hesitated.“Mermaids!” said Peter again.“Oo!”“And there are pirates.”“Pirates,” cried John, seizing his Sunday hat, “let us go atonce.”It was just at this moment that Mr. and Mrs. Darling hurried with Nana out of27. They ran into the middle of the street to look up at the nursery window;and, yes, it was still shut, but the room was ablaze with light, and mostheart-gripping sight of all, they could see in shadow on the curtain threelittle figures in night attire circling round and round, not on the floor butin the air.Not three figures, four!In a tremble they opened the street door. Mr. Darling would have rushedupstairs, but Mrs. Darling signed him to go softly. She even tried to make herheart go softly.Will they reach the nursery in time? If so, how delightful for them, and weshall all breathe a sigh of relief, but there will be no story. On the otherhand, if they are not in time, I solemnly promise that it will all come rightin the end.They would have reached the nursery in time had it not been that the littlestars were watching them. Once again the stars blew the window open, and thatsmallest star of all called out:“Cave, Peter!”Then Peter knew that there was not a moment to lose. “Come,” hecried imperiously, and soared out at once into the night, followed by John andMichael and Wendy.Mr. and Mrs. Darling and Nana rushed into the nursery too late. The birds wereflown."

Peter, you see, just said anything that came into hishead.At first his companions trusted him implicitly, and so great were the delightsof flying that they wasted time circling round church spires or any other tallobjects on the way that took their fancy.John and Michael raced, Michael getting a start.They recalled with contempt that not so long ago they had thought themselvesfine fellows for being able to fly round a room.Not long ago. But how long ago? They were flying over the sea before thisthought began to disturb Wendy seriously. John thought it was their second seaand their third night.Sometimes it was dark and sometimes light, and now they were very cold andagain too warm. Did they really feel hungry at times, or were they merelypretending, because Peter had such a jolly new way of feeding them? His way wasto pursue birds who had food in their mouths suitable for humans and snatch itfrom them; then the birds would follow and snatch it back; and they would allgo chasing each other gaily for miles, parting at last with mutual expressionsof good-will. But Wendy noticed with gentle concern that Peter did not seem toknow that this was rather an odd way of getting your bread and butter, nor eventhat there are other ways.Certainly they did not pretend to be sleepy, they were sleepy; and that was adanger, for the moment they popped off, down they fell. The awful thing wasthat Peter thought this funny.“There he goes again!” he would cry gleefully, as Michael suddenlydropped like a stone.“Save him, save him!” cried Wendy, looking with horror at the cruelsea far below. Eventually Peter would dive through the air, and catch Michaeljust before he could strike the sea, and it was lovely the way he did it; buthe always waited till the last moment, and you felt it was his cleverness thatinterested him and not the saving of human life. Also he was fond of variety,and the sport that engrossed him one moment would suddenly cease to engage him,so there was always the possibility that the next time you fell he would letyou go.He could sleep in the air without falling, by merely lying on his back andfloating, but this was, partly at least, because he was so light that if yougot behind him and blew he went faster.“Do be more polite to him,” Wendy whispered to John, when they wereplaying “Follow my Leader.”“Then tell him to stop showing off,” said John.When playing Follow my Leader, Peter would fly close to the water and toucheach shark’s tail in passing, just as in the street you may run yourfinger along an iron railing. They could not follow him in this with muchsuccess, so perhaps it was rather like showing off, especially as he keptlooking behind to see how many tails they missed.“You must be nice to him,” Wendy impressed on her brothers.“What could we do if he were to leave us!”“We could go back,” Michael said.“How could we ever find our way back without him?”“Well, then, we could go on,” said John.“That is the awful thing, John. We should have to go on, for wedon’t know how to stop.”This was true, Peter had forgotten to show them how to stop.John said that if the worst came to the worst, all they had to do was to gostraight on, for the world was round, and so in time they must come back totheir own window.“And who is to get food for us, John?”“I nipped a bit out of that eagle’s mouth pretty neatly,Wendy.”“After the twentieth try,” Wendy reminded him. “And eventhough we became good at picking up food, see how we bump against clouds andthings if he is not near to give us a hand.”Indeed they were constantly bumping. They could now fly strongly, though theystill kicked far too much; but if they saw a cloud in front of them, the morethey tried to avoid it, the more certainly did they bump into it. If Nana hadbeen with them, she would have had a bandage round Michael’s forehead bythis time.Peter was not with them for the moment, and they felt rather lonely up there bythemselves. He could go so much faster than they that he would suddenly shootout of sight, to have some adventure in which they had no share. He would comedown laughing over something fearfully funny he had been saying to a star, buthe had already forgotten what it was, or he would come up with mermaid scalesstill sticking to him, and yet not be able to say for certain what had beenhappening. It was really rather irritating to children who had never seen amermaid.“And if he forgets them so quickly,” Wendy argued, “how canwe expect that he will go on remembering us?”Indeed, sometimes when he returned he did not remember them, at least not well.Wendy was sure of it. She saw recognition come into his eyes as he was about topass them the time of day and go on; once even she had to call him by name.“I’m Wendy,” she said agitatedly.He was very sorry. “I say, Wendy,” he whispered to her,“always if you see me forgetting you, just keep on saying‘I’m Wendy,’ and then I’ll remember.”Of course this was rather unsatisfactory. However, to make amends he showedthem how to lie out flat on a strong wind that was going their way, and thiswas such a pleasant change that they tried it several times and found that theycould sleep thus with security. Indeed they would have slept longer, but Petertired quickly of sleeping, and soon he would cry in his captain voice,“We get off here.” So with occasional tiffs, but on the wholerollicking, they drew near the Neverland; for after many moons they did reachit, and, what is more, they had been going pretty straight all the time, notperhaps so much owing to the guidance of Peter or Tink as because the islandwas looking for them. It is only thus that any one may sight those magicshores.“There it is,” said Peter calmly.“Where, where?”“Where all the arrows are pointing.”Indeed a million golden arrows were pointing it out to the children, alldirected by their friend the sun, who wanted them to be sure of their waybefore leaving them for the night.Wendy and John and Michael stood on tip-toe in the air to get their first sightof the island. Strange to say, they all recognized it at once, and until fearfell upon them they hailed it, not as something long dreamt of and seen atlast, but as a familiar friend to whom they were returning home for theholidays.“John, there’s the lagoon.”“Wendy, look at the turtles burying their eggs in the sand.”“I say, John, I see your flamingo with the broken leg!”“Look, Michael, there’s your cave!”“John, what’s that in the brushwood?”“It’s a wolf with her whelps. Wendy, I do believe that’s yourlittle whelp!”“There’s my boat, John, with her sides stove in!”“No, it isn’t. Why, we burned your boat.”“That’s her, at any rate. I say, John, I see the smoke of theredskin camp!”“Where? Show me, and I’ll tell you by the way smoke curls whetherthey are on the war-path.”“There, just across the Mysterious River.”“I see now. Yes, they are on the war-path right enough.”Peter was a little annoyed with them for knowing so much, but if he wanted tolord it over them his triumph was at hand, for have I not told you that anonfear fell upon them?It came as the arrows went, leaving the island in gloom.In the old days at home the Neverland had always begun to look a little darkand threatening by bedtime. Then unexplored patches arose in it and spread,black shadows moved about in them, the roar of the beasts of prey was quitedifferent now, and above all, you lost the certainty that you would win. Youwere quite glad that the night-lights were on. You even liked Nana to say thatthis was just the mantelpiece over here, and that the Neverland was allmake-believe.Of course the Neverland had been make-believe in those days, but it was realnow, and there were no night-lights, and it was getting darker every moment,and where was Nana?They had been flying apart, but they huddled close to Peter now. His carelessmanner had gone at last, his eyes were sparkling, and a tingle went throughthem every time they touched his body. They were now over the fearsome island,flying so low that sometimes a tree grazed their feet. Nothing horrid wasvisible in the air, yet their progress had become slow and laboured, exactly asif they were pushing their way through hostile forces. Sometimes they hung inthe air until Peter had beaten on it with his fists.“They don’t want us to land,” he explained.“Who are they?” Wendy whispered, shuddering.But he could not or would not say. Tinker Bell had been asleep on his shoulder,but now he wakened her and sent her on in front.Sometimes he poised himself in the air, listening intently, with his hand tohis ear, and again he would stare down with eyes so bright that they seemed tobore two holes to earth. Having done these things, he went on again.His courage was almost appalling. “Would you like an adventurenow,” he said casually to John, “or would you like to have your teafirst?”Wendy said “tea first” quickly, and Michael pressed her hand ingratitude, but the braver John hesitated.“What kind of adventure?” he asked cautiously.“There’s a pirate asleep in the pampas just beneath us,”Peter told him. “If you like, we’ll go down and kill him.”“I don’t see him,” John said after a long pause.“I do.”“Suppose,” John said, a little huskily, “he were to wakeup.”Peter spoke indignantly. “You don’t think I would kill him while hewas sleeping! I would wake him first, and then kill him. That’s the way Ialways do.”“I say! Do you kill many?”“Tons.”John said “How ripping,” but decided to have tea first. He asked ifthere were many pirates on the island just now, and Peter said he had neverknown so many.“Who is captain now?”“Hook,” answered Peter, and his face became very stern as he saidthat hated word.“Jas. Hook?”“Ay.”Then indeed Michael began to cry, and even John could speak in gulps only, forthey knew Hook’s reputation.“He was Blackbeard’s bo’sun,” John whispered huskily.“He is the worst of them all. He is the only man of whom Barbecue wasafraid.”“That’s him,” said Peter.“What is he like? Is he big?”“He is not so big as he was.”“How do you mean?”“I cut off a bit of him.”“You!”“Yes, me,” said Peter sharply.“I wasn’t meaning to be disrespectful.”“Oh, all right.”“But, I say, what bit?”“His right hand.”“Then he can’t fight now?”“Oh, can’t he just!”“Left-hander?”“He has an iron hook instead of a right hand, and he claws withit.”“Claws!”“I say, John,” said Peter.“Yes.”“Say, ‘Ay, ay, sir.’”“Ay, ay, sir.”“There is one thing,” Peter continued, “that every boy whoserves under me has to promise, and so must you.”John paled.“It is this, if we meet Hook in open fight, you must leave him tome.”“I promise,” John said loyally.For the moment they were feeling less eerie, because Tink was flying with them,and in her light they could distinguish each other. Unfortunately she could notfly so slowly as they, and so she had to go round and round them in a circle inwhich they moved as in a halo. Wendy quite liked it, until Peter pointed outthe drawbacks.“She tells me,” he said, “that the pirates sighted us beforethe darkness came, and got Long Tom out.”“The big gun?”“Yes. And of course they must see her light, and if they guess we arenear it they are sure to let fly.”“Wendy!”“John!”“Michael!”“Tell her to go away at once, Peter,” the three criedsimultaneously, but he refused.“She thinks we have lost the way,” he replied stiffly, “andshe is rather frightened. You don’t think I would send her away all byherself when she is frightened!”For a moment the circle of light was broken, and something gave Peter a lovinglittle pinch.“Then tell her,” Wendy begged, “to put out her light.”“She can’t put it out. That is about the only thing fairiescan’t do. It just goes out of itself when she falls asleep, same as thestars.”“Then tell her to sleep at once,” John almost ordered.“She can’t sleep except when she’s sleepy. It is the onlyother thing fairies can’t do.”“Seems to me,” growled John, “these are the only two thingsworth doing.”Here he got a pinch, but not a loving one.“If only one of us had a pocket,” Peter said, “we could carryher in it.” However, they had set off in such a hurry that there was nota pocket between the four of them.He had a happy idea. John’s hat!Tink agreed to travel by hat if it was carried in the hand. John carried it,though she had hoped to be carried by Peter. Presently Wendy took the hat,because John said it struck against his knee as he flew; and this, as we shallsee, led to mischief, for Tinker Bell hated to be under an obligation to Wendy.In the black topper the light was completely hidden, and they flew on insilence. It was the stillest silence they had ever known, broken once by adistant lapping, which Peter explained was the wild beasts drinking at theford, and again by a rasping sound that might have been the branches of treesrubbing together, but he said it was the redskins sharpening their knives.Even these noises ceased. To Michael the loneliness was dreadful. “Ifonly something would make a sound!” he cried.As if in answer to his request, the air was rent by the most tremendous crashhe had ever heard. The pirates had fired Long Tom at them.The roar of it echoed through the mountains, and the echoes seemed to crysavagely, “Where are they, where are they, where are they?”Thus sharply did the terrified three learn the difference between an island ofmake-believe and the same island come true.When at last the heavens were steady again, John and Michael found themselvesalone in the darkness. John was treading the air mechanically, and Michaelwithout knowing how to float was floating.“Are you shot?” John whispered tremulously.“I haven’t tried yet,” Michael whispered back.We know now that no one had been hit. Peter, however, had been carried by thewind of the shot far out to sea, while Wendy was blown upwards with nocompanion but Tinker Bell.It would have been well for Wendy if at that moment she had dropped the hat.I don’t know whether the idea came suddenly to Tink, or whether she hadplanned it on the way, but she at once popped out of the hat and began to lureWendy to her destruction.Tink was not all bad; or, rather, she was all bad just now, but, on the otherhand, sometimes she was all good. Fairies have to be one thing or the other,because being so small they unfortunately have room for one feeling only at atime. They are, however, allowed to change, only it must be a complete change.At present she was full of jealousy of Wendy. What she said in her lovelytinkle Wendy could not of course understand, and I believe some of it was badwords, but it sounded kind, and she flew back and forward, plainly meaning“Follow me, and all will be well.”What else could poor Wendy do? She called to Peter and John and Michael, andgot only mocking echoes in reply. She did not yet know that Tink hated her withthe fierce hatred of a very woman. And so, bewildered, and now staggering inher flight, she followed Tink to her doom."

",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,THE ISLAND COME TRUE,"Feeling that Peter was on his way back, the Neverland had again woke into life.We ought to use the pluperfect and say wakened, but woke is better and wasalways used by Peter.In his absence things are usually quiet on the island. The fairies take an hourlonger in the morning, the beasts attend to their young, the redskins feedheavily for six days and nights, and when pirates and lost boys meet theymerely bite their thumbs at each other. But with the coming of Peter, who hateslethargy, they are under way again: if you put your ear to the ground now, youwould hear the whole island seething with life.On this evening the chief forces of the island were disposed as follows. Thelost boys were out looking for Peter, the pirates were out looking for the lostboys, the redskins were out looking for the pirates, and the beasts were outlooking for the redskins. They were going round and round the island, but theydid not meet because all were going at the same rate.All wanted blood except the boys, who liked it as a rule, but to-night were outto greet their captain. The boys on the island vary, of course, in numbers,according as they get killed and so on; and when they seem to be growing up,which is against the rules, Peter thins them out; but at this time there weresix of them, counting the twins as two. Let us pretend to lie here among thesugar-cane and watch them as they steal by in single file, each with his handon his dagger.They are forbidden by Peter to look in the least like him, and they wear theskins of the bears slain by themselves, in which they are so round and furrythat when they fall they roll. They have therefore become very sure-footed.The first to pass is Tootles, not the least brave but the most unfortunate ofall that gallant band. He had been in fewer adventures than any of them,because the big things constantly happened just when he had stepped round thecorner; all would be quiet, he would take the opportunity of going off togather a few sticks for firewood, and then when he returned the others would besweeping up the blood. This ill-luck had given a gentle melancholy to hiscountenance, but instead of souring his nature had sweetened it, so that he wasquite the humblest of the boys. Poor kind Tootles, there is danger in the airfor you to-night. Take care lest an adventure is now offered you, which, ifaccepted, will plunge you in deepest woe. Tootles, the fairy Tink, who is benton mischief this night is looking for a tool, and she thinks you are the mosteasily tricked of the boys. ’Ware Tinker Bell.Would that he could hear us, but we are not really on the island, and he passesby, biting his knuckles.Next comes Nibs, the gay and debonair, followed by Slightly, who cuts whistlesout of the trees and dances ecstatically to his own tunes. Slightly is the mostconceited of the boys. He thinks he remembers the days before he was lost, withtheir manners and customs, and this has given his nose an offensive tilt. Curlyis fourth; he is a pickle, and so often has he had to deliver up his personwhen Peter said sternly, “Stand forth the one who did this thing,”that now at the command he stands forth automatically whether he has done it ornot. Last come the Twins, who cannot be described because we should be sure tobe describing the wrong one. Peter never quite knew what twins were, and hisband were not allowed to know anything he did not know, so these two werealways vague about themselves, and did their best to give satisfaction bykeeping close together in an apologetic sort of way.The boys vanish in the gloom, and after a pause, but not a long pause, forthings go briskly on the island, come the pirates on their track. We hear thembefore they are seen, and it is always the same dreadful song:“Avast belay, yo ho, heave to,A-pirating we go,And if we’re parted by a shotWe’re sure to meet below!”A more villainous-looking lot never hung in a row on Execution dock. Here, alittle in advance, ever and again with his head to the ground listening, hisgreat arms bare, pieces of eight in his ears as ornaments, is the handsomeItalian Cecco, who cut his name in letters of blood on the back of the governorof the prison at Gao. That gigantic black behind him has had many names sincehe dropped the one with which dusky mothers still terrify their children on thebanks of the Guadjo-mo. Here is Bill Jukes, every inch of him tattooed, thesame Bill Jukes who got six dozen on the Walrus from Flint before hewould drop the bag of moidores; and Cookson, said to be Black Murphy’sbrother (but this was never proved), and Gentleman Starkey, once an usher in apublic school and still dainty in his ways of killing; and Skylights(Morgan’s Skylights); and the Irish bo’sun Smee, an oddly genialman who stabbed, so to speak, without offence, and was the only Non-conformistin Hook’s crew; and Noodler, whose hands were fixed on backwards; andRobt. Mullins and Alf Mason and many another ruffian long known and feared onthe Spanish Main.In the midst of them, the blackest and largest in that dark setting, reclinedJames Hook, or as he wrote himself, Jas. Hook, of whom it is said he was theonly man that the Sea-Cook feared. He lay at his ease in a rough chariot drawnand propelled by his men, and instead of a right hand he had the iron hook withwhich ever and anon he encouraged them to increase their pace. As dogs thisterrible man treated and addressed them, and as dogs they obeyed him. In personhe was cadaverous and blackavized, and his hair was dressed in long curls,which at a little distance looked like black candles, and gave a singularlythreatening expression to his handsome countenance. His eyes were of the blueof the forget-me-not, and of a profound melancholy, save when he was plunginghis hook into you, at which time two red spots appeared in them and lit them uphorribly. In manner, something of the grand seigneur still clung to him, sothat he even ripped you up with an air, and I have been told that he was araconteur of repute. He was never more sinister than when he was mostpolite, which is probably the truest test of breeding; and the elegance of hisdiction, even when he was swearing, no less than the distinction of hisdemeanour, showed him one of a different cast from his crew. A man ofindomitable courage, it was said that the only thing he shied at was the sightof his own blood, which was thick and of an unusual colour. In dress hesomewhat aped the attire associated with the name of Charles II, having heardit said in some earlier period of his career that he bore a strange resemblanceto the ill-fated Stuarts; and in his mouth he had a holder of his owncontrivance which enabled him to smoke two cigars at once. But undoubtedly thegrimmest part of him was his iron claw.Let us now kill a pirate, to show Hook’s method. Skylights will do. Asthey pass, Skylights lurches clumsily against him, ruffling his lace collar;the hook shoots forth, there is a tearing sound and one screech, then the bodyis kicked aside, and the pirates pass on. He has not even taken the cigars fromhis mouth.Such is the terrible man against whom Peter Pan is pitted. Which will win?On the trail of the pirates, stealing noiselessly down the war-path, which isnot visible to inexperienced eyes, come the redskins, every one of them withhis eyes peeled. They carry tomahawks and knives, and their naked bodies gleamwith paint and oil. Strung around them are scalps, of boys as well as ofpirates, for these are the Piccaninny tribe, and not to be confused with thesofter-hearted Delawares or the Hurons. In the van, on all fours, is Great BigLittle Panther, a brave of so many scalps that in his present position theysomewhat impede his progress. Bringing up the rear, the place of greatestdanger, comes Tiger Lily, proudly erect, a princess in her own right. She isthe most beautiful of dusky Dianas and the belle of the Piccaninnies,coquettish, cold and amorous by turns; there is not a brave who would not havethe wayward thing to wife, but she staves off the altar with a hatchet. Observehow they pass over fallen twigs without making the slightest noise. The onlysound to be heard is their somewhat heavy breathing. The fact is that they areall a little fat just now after the heavy gorging, but in time they will workthis off. For the moment, however, it constitutes their chief danger.The redskins disappear as they have come like shadows, and soon their place istaken by the beasts, a great and motley procession: lions, tigers, bears, andthe innumerable smaller savage things that flee from them, for every kind ofbeast, and, more particularly, all the man-eaters, live cheek by jowl on thefavoured island. Their tongues are hanging out, they are hungry to-night.When they have passed, comes the last figure of all, a gigantic crocodile. Weshall see for whom she is looking presently.The crocodile passes, but soon the boys appear again, for the procession mustcontinue indefinitely until one of the parties stops or changes its pace. Thenquickly they will be on top of each other.All are keeping a sharp look-out in front, but none suspects that the dangermay be creeping up from behind. This shows how real the island was.The first to fall out of the moving circle was the boys. They flung themselvesdown on the sward, close to their underground home.“I do wish Peter would come back,” every one of them saidnervously, though in height and still more in breadth they were all larger thantheir captain.“I am the only one who is not afraid of the pirates,” Slightlysaid, in the tone that prevented his being a general favourite; but perhapssome distant sound disturbed him, for he added hastily, “but I wish hewould come back, and tell us whether he has heard anything more aboutCinderella.”They talked of Cinderella, and Tootles was confident that his mother must havebeen very like her.It was only in Peter’s absence that they could speak of mothers, thesubject being forbidden by him as silly.“All I remember about my mother,” Nibs told them, “is thatshe often said to my father, ‘Oh, how I wish I had a cheque-book of myown!’ I don’t know what a cheque-book is, but I should just love togive my mother one.”While they talked they heard a distant sound. You or I, not being wild thingsof the woods, would have heard nothing, but they heard it, and it was the grimsong:“Yo ho, yo ho, the pirate life,The flag o’ skull and bones,A merry hour, a hempen rope,And hey for Davy Jones.”At once the lost boys—but where are they? They are no longer there.Rabbits could not have disappeared more quickly.I will tell you where they are. With the exception of Nibs, who has darted awayto reconnoitre, they are already in their home under the ground, a verydelightful residence of which we shall see a good deal presently. But how havethey reached it? for there is no entrance to be seen, not so much as a largestone, which if rolled away, would disclose the mouth of a cave. Look closely,however, and you may note that there are here seven large trees, each with ahole in its hollow trunk as large as a boy. These are the seven entrances tothe home under the ground, for which Hook has been searching in vain these manymoons. Will he find it tonight?As the pirates advanced, the quick eye of Starkey sighted Nibs disappearingthrough the wood, and at once his pistol flashed out. But an iron claw grippedhis shoulder.“Captain, let go!” he cried, writhing.Now for the first time we hear the voice of Hook. It was a black voice.“Put back that pistol first,” it said threateningly.“It was one of those boys you hate. I could have shot him dead.”“Ay, and the sound would have brought Tiger Lily’s redskins uponus. Do you want to lose your scalp?”“Shall I after him, Captain,” asked pathetic Smee, “andtickle him with Johnny Corkscrew?” Smee had pleasant names foreverything, and his cutlass was Johnny Corkscrew, because he wiggled it in thewound. One could mention many lovable traits in Smee. For instance, afterkilling, it was his spectacles he wiped instead of his weapon.“Johnny’s a silent fellow,” he reminded Hook.“Not now, Smee,” Hook said darkly. “He is only one, and Iwant to mischief all the seven. Scatter and look for them.”The pirates disappeared among the trees, and in a moment their Captain and Smeewere alone. Hook heaved a heavy sigh, and I know not why it was, perhaps it wasbecause of the soft beauty of the evening, but there came over him a desire toconfide to his faithful bo’sun the story of his life. He spoke long andearnestly, but what it was all about Smee, who was rather stupid, did not knowin the least.Anon he caught the word Peter.“Most of all,” Hook was saying passionately, “I want theircaptain, Peter Pan. ’Twas he cut off my arm.” He brandished thehook threateningly. “I’ve waited long to shake his hand with this.Oh, I’ll tear him!”“And yet,” said Smee, “I have often heard you say that hookwas worth a score of hands, for combing the hair and other homely uses.”“Ay,” the captain answered, “if I was a mother I would prayto have my children born with this instead of that,” and he cast a lookof pride upon his iron hand and one of scorn upon the other. Then again hefrowned.“Peter flung my arm,” he said, wincing, “to a crocodile thathappened to be passing by.”“I have often,” said Smee, “noticed your strange dread ofcrocodiles.”“Not of crocodiles,” Hook corrected him, “but of that onecrocodile.” He lowered his voice. “It liked my arm so much, Smee,that it has followed me ever since, from sea to sea and from land to land,licking its lips for the rest of me.”“In a way,” said Smee, “it’s sort of acompliment.”“I want no such compliments,” Hook barked petulantly. “I wantPeter Pan, who first gave the brute its taste for me.”He sat down on a large mushroom, and now there was a quiver in his voice.“Smee,” he said huskily, “that crocodile would have had mebefore this, but by a lucky chance it swallowed a clock which goes tick tickinside it, and so before it can reach me I hear the tick and bolt.” Helaughed, but in a hollow way.“Some day,” said Smee, “the clock will run down, and thenhe’ll get you.”Hook wetted his dry lips. “Ay,” he said, “that’s thefear that haunts me.”Since sitting down he had felt curiously warm. “Smee,” he said,“this seat is hot.” He jumped up. “Odds bobs, hammer andtongs I’m burning.”They examined the mushroom, which was of a size and solidity unknown on themainland; they tried to pull it up, and it came away at once in their hands,for it had no root. Stranger still, smoke began at once to ascend. The pirateslooked at each other. “A chimney!” they both exclaimed.They had indeed discovered the chimney of the home under the ground. It was thecustom of the boys to stop it with a mushroom when enemies were in theneighbourhood.Not only smoke came out of it. There came also children’s voices, for sosafe did the boys feel in their hiding-place that they were gaily chattering.The pirates listened grimly, and then replaced the mushroom. They looked aroundthem and noted the holes in the seven trees.“Did you hear them say Peter Pan’s from home?” Smeewhispered, fidgeting with Johnny Corkscrew.Hook nodded. He stood for a long time lost in thought, and at last a curdlingsmile lit up his swarthy face. Smee had been waiting for it. “Unrip yourplan, captain,” he cried eagerly.“To return to the ship,” Hook replied slowly through his teeth,“and cook a large rich cake of a jolly thickness with green sugar on it.There can be but one room below, for there is but one chimney. The silly moleshad not the sense to see that they did not need a door apiece. That shows theyhave no mother. We will leave the cake on the shore of the Mermaids’Lagoon. These boys are always swimming about there, playing with the mermaids.They will find the cake and they will gobble it up, because, having no mother,they don’t know how dangerous ’tis to eat rich damp cake.” Heburst into laughter, not hollow laughter now, but honest laughter. “Aha,they will die.”Smee had listened with growing admiration.“It’s the wickedest, prettiest policy ever I heard of!” hecried, and in their exultation they danced and sang:“Avast, belay, when I appear,By fear they’re overtook;Nought’s left upon your bones when youHave shaken claws with Hook.”They began the verse, but they never finished it, for another sound broke inand stilled them. There was at first such a tiny sound that a leaf might havefallen on it and smothered it, but as it came nearer it was more distinct.Tick tick tick tick!Hook stood shuddering, one foot in the air.“The crocodile!” he gasped, and bounded away, followed by hisbo’sun.It was indeed the crocodile. It had passed the redskins, who were now on thetrail of the other pirates. It oozed on after Hook.Once more the boys emerged into the open; but the dangers of the night were notyet over, for presently Nibs rushed breathless into their midst, pursued by apack of wolves. The tongues of the pursuers were hanging out; the baying ofthem was horrible.“Save me, save me!” cried Nibs, falling on the ground.“But what can we do, what can we do?”It was a high compliment to Peter that at that dire moment their thoughtsturned to him.“What would Peter do?” they cried simultaneously.Almost in the same breath they cried, “Peter would look at them throughhis legs.”And then, “Let us do what Peter would do.”It is quite the most successful way of defying wolves, and as one boy they bentand looked through their legs. The next moment is the long one, but victorycame quickly, for as the boys advanced upon them in the terrible attitude, thewolves dropped their tails and fled.Now Nibs rose from the ground, and the others thought that his staring eyesstill saw the wolves. But it was not wolves he saw.“I have seen a wonderfuller thing,” he cried, as they gatheredround him eagerly. “A great white bird. It is flying this way.”“What kind of a bird, do you think?”“I don’t know,” Nibs said, awestruck, “but it looks soweary, and as it flies it moans, ‘Poor Wendy.’”“Poor Wendy?”“I remember,” said Slightly instantly, “there are birdscalled Wendies.”“See, it comes!” cried Curly, pointing to Wendy in the heavens.Wendy was now almost overhead, and they could hear her plaintive cry. But moredistinct came the shrill voice of Tinker Bell. The jealous fairy had now castoff all disguise of friendship, and was darting at her victim from everydirection, pinching savagely each time she touched.“Hullo, Tink,” cried the wondering boys.Tink’s reply rang out: “Peter wants you to shoot the Wendy.”It was not in their nature to question when Peter ordered. “Let us dowhat Peter wishes!” cried the simple boys. “Quick, bows andarrows!”All but Tootles popped down their trees. He had a bow and arrow with him, andTink noted it, and rubbed her little hands.“Quick, Tootles, quick,” she screamed. “Peter will be sopleased.”Tootles excitedly fitted the arrow to his bow. “Out of the way,Tink,” he shouted, and then he fired, and Wendy fluttered to the groundwith an arrow in her breast."

They had crowded round Wendy, and as they looked aterrible silence fell upon the wood. If Wendy’s heart had been beatingthey would all have heard it.Slightly was the first to speak. “This is no bird,” he said in ascared voice. “I think this must be a lady.”“A lady?” said Tootles, and fell a-trembling.“And we have killed her,” Nibs said hoarsely.They all whipped off their caps.“Now I see,” Curly said: “Peter was bringing her tous.” He threw himself sorrowfully on the ground.“A lady to take care of us at last,” said one of the twins,“and you have killed her!”They were sorry for him, but sorrier for themselves, and when he took a stepnearer them they turned from him.Tootles’ face was very white, but there was a dignity about him now thathad never been there before.“I did it,” he said, reflecting. “When ladies used to come tome in dreams, I said, ‘Pretty mother, pretty mother.’ But when atlast she really came, I shot her.”He moved slowly away.“Don’t go,” they called in pity.“I must,” he answered, shaking; “I am so afraid ofPeter.”It was at this tragic moment that they heard a sound which made the heart ofevery one of them rise to his mouth. They heard Peter crow.“Peter!” they cried, for it was always thus that he signalled hisreturn.“Hide her,” they whispered, and gathered hastily around Wendy. ButTootles stood aloof.Again came that ringing crow, and Peter dropped in front of them.“Greetings, boys,” he cried, and mechanically they saluted, andthen again was silence.He frowned.“I am back,” he said hotly, “why do you not cheer?”They opened their mouths, but the cheers would not come. He overlooked it inhis haste to tell the glorious tidings.“Great news, boys,” he cried, “I have brought at last amother for you all.”Still no sound, except a little thud from Tootles as he dropped on his knees.“Have you not seen her?” asked Peter, becoming troubled. “Sheflew this way.”“Ah me!” one voice said, and another said, “Oh, mournfulday.”Tootles rose. “Peter,” he said quietly, “I will show her toyou,” and when the others would still have hidden her he said,“Back, twins, let Peter see.”So they all stood back, and let him see, and after he had looked for a littletime he did not know what to do next.“She is dead,” he said uncomfortably. “Perhaps she isfrightened at being dead.”He thought of hopping off in a comic sort of way till he was out of sight ofher, and then never going near the spot any more. They would all have been gladto follow if he had done this.But there was the arrow. He took it from her heart and faced his band.“Whose arrow?” he demanded sternly.“Mine, Peter,” said Tootles on his knees.“Oh, dastard hand,” Peter said, and he raised the arrow to use itas a dagger.Tootles did not flinch. He bared his breast. “Strike, Peter,” hesaid firmly, “strike true.”Twice did Peter raise the arrow, and twice did his hand fall. “I cannotstrike,” he said with awe, “there is something stays myhand.”All looked at him in wonder, save Nibs, who fortunately looked at Wendy.“It is she,” he cried, “the Wendy lady, see, her arm!”Wonderful to relate, Wendy had raised her arm. Nibs bent over her and listenedreverently. “I think she said, ‘Poor Tootles,’” hewhispered.“She lives,” Peter said briefly.Slightly cried instantly, “The Wendy lady lives.”Then Peter knelt beside her and found his button. You remember she had put iton a chain that she wore round her neck.“See,” he said, “the arrow struck against this. It is thekiss I gave her. It has saved her life.”“I remember kisses,” Slightly interposed quickly, “let me seeit. Ay, that’s a kiss.”Peter did not hear him. He was begging Wendy to get better quickly, so that hecould show her the mermaids. Of course she could not answer yet, being still ina frightful faint; but from overhead came a wailing note.“Listen to Tink,” said Curly, “she is crying because theWendy lives.”Then they had to tell Peter of Tink’s crime, and almost never had theyseen him look so stern.“Listen, Tinker Bell,” he cried, “I am your friend no more.Begone from me for ever.”She flew on to his shoulder and pleaded, but he brushed her off. Not untilWendy again raised her arm did he relent sufficiently to say, “Well, notfor ever, but for a whole week.”Do you think Tinker Bell was grateful to Wendy for raising her arm? Oh dear no,never wanted to pinch her so much. Fairies indeed are strange, and Peter, whounderstood them best, often cuffed them.But what to do with Wendy in her present delicate state of health?“Let us carry her down into the house,” Curly suggested.“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is what one does withladies.”“No, no,” Peter said, “you must not touch her. It would notbe sufficiently respectful.”“That,” said Slightly, “is what I was thinking.”“But if she lies there,” Tootles said, “she will die.”“Ay, she will die,” Slightly admitted, “but there is no wayout.”“Yes, there is,” cried Peter. “Let us build a little houseround her.”They were all delighted. “Quick,” he ordered them, “bring meeach of you the best of what we have. Gut our house. Be sharp.”In a moment they were as busy as tailors the night before a wedding. Theyskurried this way and that, down for bedding, up for firewood, and while theywere at it, who should appear but John and Michael. As they dragged along theground they fell asleep standing, stopped, woke up, moved another step andslept again.“John, John,” Michael would cry, “wake up! Where is Nana,John, and mother?”And then John would rub his eyes and mutter, “It is true, we didfly.”You may be sure they were very relieved to find Peter.“Hullo, Peter,” they said.“Hullo,” replied Peter amicably, though he had quite forgottenthem. He was very busy at the moment measuring Wendy with his feet to see howlarge a house she would need. Of course he meant to leave room for chairs and atable. John and Michael watched him.“Is Wendy asleep?” they asked.“Yes.”“John,” Michael proposed, “let us wake her and get her tomake supper for us,” but as he said it some of the other boys rushed oncarrying branches for the building of the house. “Look at them!” hecried.“Curly,” said Peter in his most captainy voice, “see thatthese boys help in the building of the house.”“Ay, ay, sir.”“Build a house?” exclaimed John.“For the Wendy,” said Curly.“For Wendy?” John said, aghast. “Why, she is only agirl!”“That,” explained Curly, “is why we are her servants.”“You? Wendy’s servants!”“Yes,” said Peter, “and you also. Away with them.”The astounded brothers were dragged away to hack and hew and carry.“Chairs and a fender first,” Peter ordered. “Then we shallbuild a house round them.”“Ay,” said Slightly, “that is how a house is built; it allcomes back to me.”Peter thought of everything. “Slightly,” he cried, “fetch adoctor.”“Ay, ay,” said Slightly at once, and disappeared, scratching hishead. But he knew Peter must be obeyed, and he returned in a moment, wearingJohn’s hat and looking solemn.“Please, sir,” said Peter, going to him, “are you adoctor?”The difference between him and the other boys at such a time was that they knewit was make-believe, while to him make-believe and true were exactly the samething. This sometimes troubled them, as when they had to make-believe that theyhad had their dinners.If they broke down in their make-believe he rapped them on the knuckles.“Yes, my little man,” Slightly anxiously replied, who had chappedknuckles.“Please, sir,” Peter explained, “a lady lies very ill.”She was lying at their feet, but Slightly had the sense not to see her.“Tut, tut, tut,” he said, “where does she lie?”“In yonder glade.”“I will put a glass thing in her mouth,” said Slightly, and hemade-believe to do it, while Peter waited. It was an anxious moment when theglass thing was withdrawn.“How is she?” inquired Peter.“Tut, tut, tut,” said Slightly, “this has cured her.”“I am glad!” Peter cried.“I will call again in the evening,” Slightly said; “give herbeef tea out of a cup with a spout to it;” but after he had returned thehat to John he blew big breaths, which was his habit on escaping from adifficulty.In the meantime the wood had been alive with the sound of axes; almosteverything needed for a cosy dwelling already lay at Wendy’s feet.“If only we knew,” said one, “the kind of house she likesbest.”“Peter,” shouted another, “she is moving in her sleep.”“Her mouth opens,” cried a third, looking respectfully into it.“Oh, lovely!”“Perhaps she is going to sing in her sleep,” said Peter.“Wendy, sing the kind of house you would like to have.”Immediately, without opening her eyes, Wendy began to sing:“I wish I had a pretty house,The littlest ever seen,With funny little red wallsAnd roof of mossy green.”They gurgled with joy at this, for by the greatest good luck the branches theyhad brought were sticky with red sap, and all the ground was carpeted withmoss. As they rattled up the little house they broke into song themselves:“We’ve built the little walls and roofAnd made a lovely door,So tell us, mother Wendy,What are you wanting more?”To this she answered greedily:“Oh, really next I think I’ll haveGay windows all about,With roses peeping in, you know,And babies peeping out.”With a blow of their fists they made windows, and large yellow leaves were theblinds. But roses—?“Roses,” cried Peter sternly.Quickly they made-believe to grow the loveliest roses up the walls.Babies?To prevent Peter ordering babies they hurried into song again:“We’ve made the roses peeping out,The babes are at the door,We cannot make ourselves, you know,’Cos we’ve been made before.”Peter, seeing this to be a good idea, at once pretended that it was his own.The house was quite beautiful, and no doubt Wendy was very cosy within, though,of course, they could no longer see her. Peter strode up and down, orderingfinishing touches. Nothing escaped his eagle eyes. Just when it seemedabsolutely finished:“There’s no knocker on the door,” he said.They were very ashamed, but Tootles gave the sole of his shoe, and it made anexcellent knocker.Absolutely finished now, they thought.Not of bit of it. “There’s no chimney,” Peter said; “wemust have a chimney.”“It certainly does need a chimney,” said John importantly. Thisgave Peter an idea. He snatched the hat off John’s head, knocked out thebottom, and put the hat on the roof. The little house was so pleased to havesuch a capital chimney that, as if to say thank you, smoke immediately began tocome out of the hat.Now really and truly it was finished. Nothing remained to do but to knock.“All look your best,” Peter warned them; “first impressionsare awfully important.”He was glad no one asked him what first impressions are; they were all too busylooking their best.He knocked politely, and now the wood was as still as the children, not a soundto be heard except from Tinker Bell, who was watching from a branch and openlysneering.What the boys were wondering was, would any one answer the knock? If a lady,what would she be like?The door opened and a lady came out. It was Wendy. They all whipped off theirhats.She looked properly surprised, and this was just how they had hoped she wouldlook.“Where am I?” she said.Of course Slightly was the first to get his word in. “Wendy lady,”he said rapidly, “for you we built this house.”“Oh, say you’re pleased,” cried Nibs.“Lovely, darling house,” Wendy said, and they were the very wordsthey had hoped she would say.“And we are your children,” cried the twins.Then all went on their knees, and holding out their arms cried, “O Wendylady, be our mother.”“Ought I?” Wendy said, all shining. “Of course it’sfrightfully fascinating, but you see I am only a little girl. I have no realexperience.”“That doesn’t matter,” said Peter, as if he were the onlyperson present who knew all about it, though he was really the one who knewleast. “What we need is just a nice motherly person.”“Oh dear!” Wendy said, “you see, I feel that is exactly whatI am.”“It is, it is,” they all cried; “we saw it at once.”“Very well,” she said, “I will do my best. Come inside atonce, you naughty children; I am sure your feet are damp. And before I put youto bed I have just time to finish the story of Cinderella.”In they went; I don’t know how there was room for them, but you cansqueeze very tight in the Neverland. And that was the first of the many joyousevenings they had with Wendy. By and by she tucked them up in the great bed inthe home under the trees, but she herself slept that night in the little house,and Peter kept watch outside with drawn sword, for the pirates could be heardcarousing far away and the wolves were on the prowl. The little house looked socosy and safe in the darkness, with a bright light showing through its blinds,and the chimney smoking beautifully, and Peter standing on guard. After a timehe fell asleep, and some unsteady fairies had to climb over him on their wayhome from an orgy. Any of the other boys obstructing the fairy path at nightthey would have mischiefed, but they just tweaked Peter’s nose and passedon."

",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND,"One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John andMichael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys forthinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless yourtree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys werequite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in your breath at the top, anddown you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and letout alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered theaction you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothingcan be more graceful.But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully asfor a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made tofit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. Usually it is done quiteeasily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpyin awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does somethings to you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be takento go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps awhole family in perfect condition.Wendy and Michael fitted their trees at the first try, but John had to bealtered a little.After a few days’ practice they could go up and down as gaily as bucketsin a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground;especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, witha floor in which you could dig if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floorgrew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Nevertree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawedthe trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about twofeet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming atable; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thusthere was more room to play. There was an enormous fireplace which was inalmost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendystretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bedwas tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearlyhalf the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying likesardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gavethe signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, butWendy would have a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are,and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of anunderground house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in thewall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of TinkerBell. It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, whichTink, who was most fastidious, always kept drawn when dressing or undressing.No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir andbed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine QueenMab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to whatfruit-blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there arenow only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crustand reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and thecarpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was achandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she litthe residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, asindeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked ratherconceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagiousboys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, exceptperhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. Thecooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there wasnothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it cameaboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real mealor just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter’s whim: he could eat,really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge just to feelstodgy, which is what most children like better than anything else; the nextbest thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that duringa meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying, butyou simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you weregetting loose for your tree he let you stodge.Wendy’s favourite time for sewing and darning was after they had all goneto bed. Then, as she expressed it, she had a breathing time for herself; andshe occupied it in making new things for them, and putting double pieces on theknees, for they were all most frightfully hard on their knees.When she sat down to a basketful of their stockings, every heel with a hole init, she would fling up her arms and exclaim, “Oh dear, I am sure Isometimes think spinsters are to be envied!”Her face beamed when she exclaimed this.You remember about her pet wolf. Well, it very soon discovered that she hadcome to the island and it found her out, and they just ran into eachother’s arms. After that it followed her about everywhere.As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had leftbehind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to sayhow time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons andsuns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I amafraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she wasabsolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to flyback by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at timeswas that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known,while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother.These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she triedto fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, aslike as possible to the ones she used to do at school. The other boys thoughtthis awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates forthemselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about thequestions she had written on another slate and passed round. They were the mostordinary questions—“What was the colour of Mother’s eyes?Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer allthree questions if possible.” “(A) Write an essay of not less than40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Characters of Father andMother compared. Only one of these to be attempted.” Or “(1)Describe Mother’s laugh; (2) Describe Father’s laugh; (3) DescribeMother’s Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate.”They were just everyday questions like these, and when you could not answerthem you were told to make a cross; and it was really dreadful what a number ofcrosses even John made. Of course the only boy who replied to every questionwas Slightly, and no one could have been more hopeful of coming out first, buthis answers were perfectly ridiculous, and he really came out last: amelancholy thing.Peter did not compete. For one thing he despised all mothers except Wendy, andfor another he was the only boy on the island who could neither write norspell; not the smallest word. He was above all that sort of thing.By the way, the questions were all written in the past tense. What was thecolour of Mother’s eyes, and so on. Wendy, you see, had been forgetting,too.Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but aboutthis time Peter invented, with Wendy’s help, a new game that fascinatedhim enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as youhave been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted inpretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michaelhad been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air,pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killedso much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight;he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him sucha comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of hishealth. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him;and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he wouldhave treated them severely.He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutelycertain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it socompletely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you foundthe body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yetyou could not find the body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, andthen Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told adazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however,many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, andthere were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys werein them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require abook as large as an English-Latin, Latin-English Dictionary, and the most wecan do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. Thedifficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskinsat Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary affair, and especially interesting asshowing one of Peter’s peculiarities, which was that in the middle of afight he would suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still inthe balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out,“I’m redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?” And Tootlesanswered, “Redskin; what are you, Nibs?” and Nibs said,“Redskin; what are you Twin?” and so on; and they were allredskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the realredskins fascinated by Peter’s methods, agreed to be lost boys for thatonce, and so at it they all went again, more fiercely than ever.The extraordinary upshot of this adventure was—but we have not decidedyet that this is the adventure we are to narrate. Perhaps a better one would bethe night attack by the redskins on the house under the ground, when several ofthem stuck in the hollow trees and had to be pulled out like corks. Or we mighttell how Peter saved Tiger Lily’s life in the Mermaids’ Lagoon, andso made her his ally.Or we could tell of that cake the pirates cooked so that the boys might eat itand perish; and how they placed it in one cunning spot after another; butalways Wendy snatched it from the hands of her children, so that in time itlost its succulence, and became as hard as a stone, and was used as a missile,and Hook fell over it in the dark.Or suppose we tell of the birds that were Peter’s friends, particularlyof the Never bird that built in a tree overhanging the lagoon, and how the nestfell into the water, and still the bird sat on her eggs, and Peter gave ordersthat she was not to be disturbed. That is a pretty story, and the end shows howgrateful a bird can be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventureof the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than justone. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell’sattempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendyconveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gaveway and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, wemight choose Peter’s defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle roundhim on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though hewaited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly fromtrees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.Which of these adventures shall we choose? The best way will be to toss for it.I have tossed, and the lagoon has won. This almost makes one wish that thegulch or the cake or Tink’s leaf had won. Of course I could do it again,and make it best out of three; however, perhaps fairest to stick to the lagoon."

But just before they go on fireyou see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland,just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surfand hear the mermaids singing.The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floatingmost of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. Youmust not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: onthe contrary, it was among Wendy’s lasting regrets that all the time shewas on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stolesoftly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially onMarooners’ Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in alazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as itwere, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probablysplashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chattedwith them on Marooners’ Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails whenthey got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, whenthey utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then,and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen thelagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompaniedher, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven.She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when themermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. Thebubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting themgaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in therainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and thekeepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these gameswill be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves,for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that theysecretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them;for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead ofthe hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has lefton the Neverland.It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock forhalf an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, andit had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they laythere in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside themand looked important.It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners’ Rock. The rock wasnot much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not totake up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyesshut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. Shewas very busy, stitching.While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, andthe sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendycould no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoonthat had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable andunfriendly.It was not, she knew, that night had come, but something as dark as night hadcome. No, worse than that. It had not come, but it had sent that shiver throughthe sea to say that it was coming. What was it?There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners’Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there todrown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because ofthe unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer goodfor them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and shedid not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half anhour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed tohear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound ofmuffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. Shestood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?It was well for those boys then that there was one among them who could sniffdanger even in his sleep. Peter sprang erect, as wide awake at once as a dog,and with one warning cry he roused the others.He stood motionless, one hand to his ear.“Pirates!” he cried. The others came closer to him. A strange smilewas playing about his face, and Wendy saw it and shuddered. While that smilewas on his face no one dared address him; all they could do was to stand readyto obey. The order came sharp and incisive.“Dive!”There was a gleam of legs, and instantly the lagoon seemed deserted.Marooners’ Rock stood alone in the forbidding waters as if it were itselfmarooned.The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smeeand Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands andankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left onthe rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fireor torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is nopath through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; shewas the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief’s daughter, it isenough.They had caught her boarding the pirate ship with a knife in her mouth. Nowatch was kept on the ship, it being Hook’s boast that the wind of hisname guarded the ship for a mile around. Now her fate would help to guard italso. One more wail would go the round in that wind by night.In the gloom that they brought with them the two pirates did not see the rocktill they crashed into it.“Luff, you lubber,” cried an Irish voice that was Smee’s;“here’s the rock. Now, then, what we have to do is to hoist theredskin on to it and leave her here to drown.”It was the work of one brutal moment to land the beautiful girl on the rock;she was too proud to offer a vain resistance.Quite near the rock, but out of sight, two heads were bobbing up and down,Peter’s and Wendy’s. Wendy was crying, for it was the first tragedyshe had seen. Peter had seen many tragedies, but he had forgotten them all. Hewas less sorry than Wendy for Tiger Lily: it was two against one that angeredhim, and he meant to save her. An easy way would have been to wait until thepirates had gone, but he was never one to choose the easy way.There was almost nothing he could not do, and he now imitated the voice ofHook.“Ahoy there, you lubbers!” he called. It was a marvellousimitation.“The captain!” said the pirates, staring at each other in surprise.“He must be swimming out to us,” Starkey said, when they had lookedfor him in vain.“We are putting the redskin on the rock,” Smee called out.“Set her free,” came the astonishing answer.“Free!”“Yes, cut her bonds and let her go.”“But, captain—”“At once, d’ye hear,” cried Peter, “or I’llplunge my hook in you.”“This is queer!” Smee gasped.“Better do what the captain orders,” said Starkey nervously.“Ay, ay,” Smee said, and he cut Tiger Lily’s cords. At oncelike an eel she slid between Starkey’s legs into the water.Of course Wendy was very elated over Peter’s cleverness; but she knewthat he would be elated also and very likely crow and thus betray himself, soat once her hand went out to cover his mouth. But it was stayed even in theact, for “Boat ahoy!” rang over the lagoon in Hook’s voice,and this time it was not Peter who had spoken.Peter may have been about to crow, but his face puckered in a whistle ofsurprise instead.“Boat ahoy!” again came the voice.Now Wendy understood. The real Hook was also in the water.He was swimming to the boat, and as his men showed a light to guide him he hadsoon reached them. In the light of the lantern Wendy saw his hook grip theboat’s side; she saw his evil swarthy face as he rose dripping from thewater, and, quaking, she would have liked to swim away, but Peter would notbudge. He was tingling with life and also top-heavy with conceit. “Am Inot a wonder, oh, I am a wonder!” he whispered to her, and though shethought so also, she was really glad for the sake of his reputation that no oneheard him except herself.He signed to her to listen.The two pirates were very curious to know what had brought their captain tothem, but he sat with his head on his hook in a position of profoundmelancholy.“Captain, is all well?” they asked timidly, but he answered with ahollow moan.“He sighs,” said Smee.“He sighs again,” said Starkey.“And yet a third time he sighs,” said Smee.Then at last he spoke passionately.“The game’s up,” he cried, “those boys have found amother.”Affrighted though she was, Wendy swelled with pride.“O evil day!” cried Starkey.“What’s a mother?” asked the ignorant Smee.Wendy was so shocked that she exclaimed. “He doesn’t know!”and always after this she felt that if you could have a pet pirate Smee wouldbe her one.Peter pulled her beneath the water, for Hook had started up, crying,“What was that?”“I heard nothing,” said Starkey, raising the lantern over thewaters, and as the pirates looked they saw a strange sight. It was the nest Ihave told you of, floating on the lagoon, and the Never bird was sitting on it.“See,” said Hook in answer to Smee’s question, “that isa mother. What a lesson! The nest must have fallen into the water, but wouldthe mother desert her eggs? No.”There was a break in his voice, as if for a moment he recalled innocent dayswhen—but he brushed away this weakness with his hook.Smee, much impressed, gazed at the bird as the nest was borne past, but themore suspicious Starkey said, “If she is a mother, perhaps she is hangingabout here to help Peter.”Hook winced. “Ay,” he said, “that is the fear that hauntsme.”He was roused from this dejection by Smee’s eager voice.“Captain,” said Smee, “could we not kidnap these boys’mother and make her our mother?”“It is a princely scheme,” cried Hook, and at once it tookpractical shape in his great brain. “We will seize the children and carrythem to the boat: the boys we will make walk the plank, and Wendy shall be ourmother.”Again Wendy forgot herself.“Never!” she cried, and bobbed.“What was that?”But they could see nothing. They thought it must have been a leaf in the wind.“Do you agree, my bullies?” asked Hook.“There is my hand on it,” they both said.“And there is my hook. Swear.”They all swore. By this time they were on the rock, and suddenly Hookremembered Tiger Lily.“Where is the redskin?” he demanded abruptly.He had a playful humour at moments, and they thought this was one of themoments.“That is all right, captain,” Smee answered complacently; “welet her go.”“Let her go!” cried Hook.“’Twas your own orders,” the bo’sun faltered.“You called over the water to us to let her go,” said Starkey.“Brimstone and gall,” thundered Hook, “what cozening is goingon here!” His face had gone black with rage, but he saw that theybelieved their words, and he was startled. “Lads,” he said, shakinga little, “I gave no such order.”“It is passing queer,” Smee said, and they all fidgeteduncomfortably. Hook raised his voice, but there was a quiver in it.“Spirit that haunts this dark lagoon to-night,” he cried,“dost hear me?”Of course Peter should have kept quiet, but of course he did not. Heimmediately answered in Hook’s voice:“Odds, bobs, hammer and tongs, I hear you.”In that supreme moment Hook did not blanch, even at the gills, but Smee andStarkey clung to each other in terror.“Who are you, stranger? Speak!” Hook demanded.“I am James Hook,” replied the voice, “captain of theJolly Roger.”“You are not; you are not,” Hook cried hoarsely.“Brimstone and gall,” the voice retorted, “say that again,and I’ll cast anchor in you.”Hook tried a more ingratiating manner. “If you are Hook,” he saidalmost humbly, “come tell me, who am I?”“A codfish,” replied the voice, “only a codfish.”“A codfish!” Hook echoed blankly, and it was then, but not tillthen, that his proud spirit broke. He saw his men draw back from him.“Have we been captained all this time by a codfish!” they muttered.“It is lowering to our pride.”They were his dogs snapping at him, but, tragic figure though he had become, hescarcely heeded them. Against such fearful evidence it was not their belief inhim that he needed, it was his own. He felt his ego slipping from him.“Don’t desert me, bully,” he whispered hoarsely to it.In his dark nature there was a touch of the feminine, as in all the greatpirates, and it sometimes gave him intuitions. Suddenly he tried the guessinggame.“Hook,” he called, “have you another voice?”Now Peter could never resist a game, and he answered blithely in his own voice,“I have.”“And another name?”“Ay, ay.”“Vegetable?” asked Hook.“No.”“Mineral?”“No.”“Animal?”“Yes.”“Man?”“No!” This answer rang out scornfully.“Boy?”“Yes.”“Ordinary boy?”“No!”“Wonderful boy?”To Wendy’s pain the answer that rang out this time was “Yes.”“Are you in England?”“No.”“Are you here?”“Yes.”Hook was completely puzzled. “You ask him some questions,” he saidto the others, wiping his damp brow.Smee reflected. “I can’t think of a thing,” he saidregretfully.“Can’t guess, can’t guess!” crowed Peter. “Do yougive it up?”Of course in his pride he was carrying the game too far, and the miscreantssaw their chance.“Yes, yes,” they answered eagerly.“Well, then,” he cried, “I am Peter Pan.”Pan!In a moment Hook was himself again, and Smee and Starkey were his faithfulhenchmen.“Now we have him,” Hook shouted. “Into the water, Smee.Starkey, mind the boat. Take him dead or alive!”He leaped as he spoke, and simultaneously came the gay voice of Peter.“Are you ready, boys?”“Ay, ay,” from various parts of the lagoon.“Then lam into the pirates.”The fight was short and sharp. First to draw blood was John, who gallantlyclimbed into the boat and held Starkey. There was fierce struggle, in which thecutlass was torn from the pirate’s grasp. He wriggled overboard and Johnleapt after him. The dinghy drifted away.Here and there a head bobbed up in the water, and there was a flash of steelfollowed by a cry or a whoop. In the confusion some struck at their own side.The corkscrew of Smee got Tootles in the fourth rib, but he was himself pinkedin turn by Curly. Farther from the rock Starkey was pressing Slightly and thetwins hard.Where all this time was Peter? He was seeking bigger game.The others were all brave boys, and they must not be blamed for backing fromthe pirate captain. His iron claw made a circle of dead water round him, fromwhich they fled like affrighted fishes.But there was one who did not fear him: there was one prepared to enter thatcircle.Strangely, it was not in the water that they met. Hook rose to the rock tobreathe, and at the same moment Peter scaled it on the opposite side. The rockwas slippery as a ball, and they had to crawl rather than climb. Neither knewthat the other was coming. Each feeling for a grip met the other’s arm:in surprise they raised their heads; their faces were almost touching; so theymet.Some of the greatest heroes have confessed that just before they fell to theyhad a sinking. Had it been so with Peter at that moment I would admit it. Afterall, he was the only man that the Sea-Cook had feared. But Peter had nosinking, he had one feeling only, gladness; and he gnashed his pretty teethwith joy. Quick as thought he snatched a knife from Hook’s belt and wasabout to drive it home, when he saw that he was higher up the rock than hisfoe. It would not have been fighting fair. He gave the pirate a hand to helphim up.It was then that Hook bit him.Not the pain of this but its unfairness was what dazed Peter. It made him quitehelpless. He could only stare, horrified. Every child is affected thus thefirst time he is treated unfairly. All he thinks he has a right to when hecomes to you to be yours is fairness. After you have been unfair to him he willlove you again, but will never afterwards be quite the same boy. No one evergets over the first unfairness; no one except Peter. He often met it, but healways forgot it. I suppose that was the real difference between him and allthe rest.So when he met it now it was like the first time; and he could just stare,helpless. Twice the iron hand clawed him.A few moments afterwards the other boys saw Hook in the water striking wildlyfor the ship; no elation on the pestilent face now, only white fear, for thecrocodile was in dogged pursuit of him. On ordinary occasions the boys wouldhave swum alongside cheering; but now they were uneasy, for they had lost bothPeter and Wendy, and were scouring the lagoon for them, calling them by name.They found the dinghy and went home in it, shouting “Peter, Wendy”as they went, but no answer came save mocking laughter from the mermaids.“They must be swimming back or flying,” the boys concluded. Theywere not very anxious, because they had such faith in Peter. They chuckled,boylike, because they would be late for bed; and it was all motherWendy’s fault!When their voices died away there came cold silence over the lagoon, and then afeeble cry.“Help, help!”Two small figures were beating against the rock; the girl had fainted and layon the boy’s arm. With a last effort Peter pulled her up the rock andthen lay down beside her. Even as he also fainted he saw that the water wasrising. He knew that they would soon be drowned, but he could do no more.As they lay side by side a mermaid caught Wendy by the feet, and began pullingher softly into the water. Peter, feeling her slip from him, woke with a start,and was just in time to draw her back. But he had to tell her the truth.“We are on the rock, Wendy,” he said, “but it is growingsmaller. Soon the water will be over it.”She did not understand even now.“We must go,” she said, almost brightly.“Yes,” he answered faintly.“Shall we swim or fly, Peter?”He had to tell her.“Do you think you could swim or fly as far as the island, Wendy, withoutmy help?”She had to admit that she was too tired.He moaned.“What is it?” she asked, anxious about him at once.“I can’t help you, Wendy. Hook wounded me. I can neither fly norswim.”“Do you mean we shall both be drowned?”“Look how the water is rising.”They put their hands over their eyes to shut out the sight. They thought theywould soon be no more. As they sat thus something brushed against Peter aslight as a kiss, and stayed there, as if saying timidly, “Can I be of anyuse?”It was the tail of a kite, which Michael had made some days before. It had tornitself out of his hand and floated away.“Michael’s kite,” Peter said without interest, but nextmoment he had seized the tail, and was pulling the kite toward him.“It lifted Michael off the ground,” he cried; “why should itnot carry you?”“Both of us!”“It can’t lift two; Michael and Curly tried.”“Let us draw lots,” Wendy said bravely.“And you a lady; never.” Already he had tied the tail round her.She clung to him; she refused to go without him; but with a “Good-bye,Wendy,” he pushed her from the rock; and in a few minutes she was borneout of his sight. Peter was alone on the lagoon.The rock was very small now; soon it would be submerged. Pale rays of lighttiptoed across the waters; and by and by there was to be heard a sound at oncethe most musical and the most melancholy in the world: the mermaids calling tothe moon.Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ranthrough him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudderfollows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one.Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on hisface and a drum beating within him. It was saying, “To die will be anawfully big adventure.”"

He was too far away to heartheir doors shut; but every door in the coral caves where they live rings atiny bell when it opens or closes (as in all the nicest houses on themainland), and he heard the bells.Steadily the waters rose till they were nibbling at his feet; and to pass thetime until they made their final gulp, he watched the only thing on the lagoon.He thought it was a piece of floating paper, perhaps part of the kite, andwondered idly how long it would take to drift ashore.Presently he noticed as an odd thing that it was undoubtedly out upon thelagoon with some definite purpose, for it was fighting the tide, and sometimeswinning; and when it won, Peter, always sympathetic to the weaker side, couldnot help clapping; it was such a gallant piece of paper.It was not really a piece of paper; it was the Never bird, making desperateefforts to reach Peter on the nest. By working her wings, in a way she hadlearned since the nest fell into the water, she was able to some extent toguide her strange craft, but by the time Peter recognised her she was veryexhausted. She had come to save him, to give him her nest, though there wereeggs in it. I rather wonder at the bird, for though he had been nice to her, hehad also sometimes tormented her. I can suppose only that, like Mrs. Darlingand the rest of them, she was melted because he had all his first teeth.She called out to him what she had come for, and he called out to her what shewas doing there; but of course neither of them understood the other’slanguage. In fanciful stories people can talk to the birds freely, and I wishfor the moment I could pretend that this were such a story, and say that Peterreplied intelligently to the Never bird; but truth is best, and I want to tellyou only what really happened. Well, not only could they not understand eachother, but they forgot their manners.“I—want—you—to—get—into—the—nest,”the bird called, speaking as slowly and distinctly as possible,“and—then—you—can—drift—ashore,but—I—am—too—tired—to—bring—it—any—nearer—so—you—must—tryto—swim—to—it.”“What are you quacking about?” Peter answered. “Whydon’t you let the nest drift as usual?”“I—want—you—” the bird said, and repeated it allover.Then Peter tried slow and distinct.“What—are—you—quacking—about?” and so on.The Never bird became irritated; they have very short tempers.“You dunderheaded little jay!” she screamed, “Why don’tyou do as I tell you?”Peter felt that she was calling him names, and at a venture he retorted hotly:“So are you!”Then rather curiously they both snapped out the same remark:“Shut up!”“Shut up!”Nevertheless the bird was determined to save him if she could, and by one lastmighty effort she propelled the nest against the rock. Then up she flew;deserting her eggs, so as to make her meaning clear.Then at last he understood, and clutched the nest and waved his thanks to thebird as she fluttered overhead. It was not to receive his thanks, however, thatshe hung there in the sky; it was not even to watch him get into the nest; itwas to see what he did with her eggs.There were two large white eggs, and Peter lifted them up and reflected. Thebird covered her face with her wings, so as not to see the last of them; butshe could not help peeping between the feathers.I forget whether I have told you that there was a stave on the rock, driveninto it by some buccaneers of long ago to mark the site of buried treasure. Thechildren had discovered the glittering hoard, and when in a mischievous moodused to fling showers of moidores, diamonds, pearls and pieces of eight to thegulls, who pounced upon them for food, and then flew away, raging at the scurvytrick that had been played upon them. The stave was still there, and on itStarkey had hung his hat, a deep tarpaulin, watertight, with a broad brim.Peter put the eggs into this hat and set it on the lagoon. It floatedbeautifully.The Never bird saw at once what he was up to, and screamed her admiration ofhim; and, alas, Peter crowed his agreement with her. Then he got into the nest,reared the stave in it as a mast, and hung up his shirt for a sail. At the samemoment the bird fluttered down upon the hat and once more sat snugly on hereggs. She drifted in one direction, and he was borne off in another, bothcheering.Of course when Peter landed he beached his barque in a place where the birdwould easily find it; but the hat was such a great success that she abandonedthe nest. It drifted about till it went to pieces, and often Starkey came tothe shore of the lagoon, and with many bitter feelings watched the bird sittingon his hat. As we shall not see her again, it may be worth mentioning here thatall Never birds now build in that shape of nest, with a broad brim on which theyoungsters take an airing.Great were the rejoicings when Peter reached the home under the ground almostas soon as Wendy, who had been carried hither and thither by the kite. Everyboy had adventures to tell; but perhaps the biggest adventure of all was thatthey were several hours late for bed. This so inflated them that they didvarious dodgy things to get staying up still longer, such as demandingbandages; but Wendy, though glorying in having them all home again safe andsound, was scandalised by the lateness of the hour, and cried, “To bed,to bed,” in a voice that had to be obeyed. Next day, however, she wasawfully tender, and gave out bandages to every one, and they played tillbed-time at limping about and carrying their arms in slings."

Peter had saved Tiger Lily from a dreadful fate, and now therewas nothing she and her braves would not do for him. All night they sat above,keeping watch over the home under the ground and awaiting the big attack by thepirates which obviously could not be much longer delayed. Even by day they hungabout, smoking the pipe of peace, and looking almost as if they wanted tit-bitsto eat.They called Peter the Great White Father, prostrating themselves before him;and he liked this tremendously, so that it was not really good for him.“The great white father,” he would say to them in a very lordlymanner, as they grovelled at his feet, “is glad to see the Piccaninnywarriors protecting his wigwam from the pirates.”“Me Tiger Lily,” that lovely creature would reply. “Peter Pansave me, me his velly nice friend. Me no let pirates hurt him.”She was far too pretty to cringe in this way, but Peter thought it his due, andhe would answer condescendingly, “It is good. Peter Pan hasspoken.”Always when he said, “Peter Pan has spoken,” it meant that theymust now shut up, and they accepted it humbly in that spirit; but they were byno means so respectful to the other boys, whom they looked upon as justordinary braves. They said “How-do?” to them, and things like that;and what annoyed the boys was that Peter seemed to think this all right.Secretly Wendy sympathised with them a little, but she was far too loyal ahousewife to listen to any complaints against father. “Father knowsbest,” she always said, whatever her private opinion must be. Her privateopinion was that the redskins should not call her a squaw.We have now reached the evening that was to be known among them as the Night ofNights, because of its adventures and their upshot. The day, as if quietlygathering its forces, had been almost uneventful, and now the redskins in theirblankets were at their posts above, while, below, the children were havingtheir evening meal; all except Peter, who had gone out to get the time. The wayyou got the time on the island was to find the crocodile, and then stay nearhim till the clock struck.The meal happened to be a make-believe tea, and they sat around the board,guzzling in their greed; and really, what with their chatter andrecriminations, the noise, as Wendy said, was positively deafening. To be sure,she did not mind noise, but she simply would not have them grabbing things, andthen excusing themselves by saying that Tootles had pushed their elbow. Therewas a fixed rule that they must never hit back at meals, but should refer thematter of dispute to Wendy by raising the right arm politely and saying,“I complain of so-and-so;” but what usually happened was that theyforgot to do this or did it too much.“Silence,” cried Wendy when for the twentieth time she had toldthem that they were not all to speak at once. “Is your mug empty,Slightly darling?”“Not quite empty, mummy,” Slightly said, after looking into animaginary mug.“He hasn’t even begun to drink his milk,” Nibs interposed.This was telling, and Slightly seized his chance.“I complain of Nibs,” he cried promptly.John, however, had held up his hand first.“Well, John?”“May I sit in Peter’s chair, as he is not here?”“Sit in father’s chair, John!” Wendy was scandalised.“Certainly not.”“He is not really our father,” John answered. “Hedidn’t even know how a father does till I showed him.”This was grumbling. “We complain of John,” cried the twins.Tootles held up his hand. He was so much the humblest of them, indeed he wasthe only humble one, that Wendy was specially gentle with him.“I don’t suppose,” Tootles said diffidently, “that Icould be father.”“No, Tootles.”Once Tootles began, which was not very often, he had a silly way of going on.“As I can’t be father,” he said heavily, “I don’tsuppose, Michael, you would let me be baby?”“No, I won’t,” Michael rapped out. He was already in hisbasket.“As I can’t be baby,” Tootles said, getting heavier andheavier and heavier, “do you think I could be a twin?”“No, indeed,” replied the twins; “it’s awfullydifficult to be a twin.”“As I can’t be anything important,” said Tootles,“would any of you like to see me do a trick?”“No,” they all replied.Then at last he stopped. “I hadn’t really any hope,” he said.The hateful telling broke out again.“Slightly is coughing on the table.”“The twins began with cheese-cakes.”“Curly is taking both butter and honey.”“Nibs is speaking with his mouth full.”“I complain of the twins.”“I complain of Curly.”“I complain of Nibs.”“Oh dear, oh dear,” cried Wendy, “I’m sure I sometimesthink that spinsters are to be envied.”She told them to clear away, and sat down to her work-basket, a heavy load ofstockings and every knee with a hole in it as usual.“Wendy,” remonstrated Michael, “I’m too big for acradle.”“I must have somebody in a cradle,” she said almost tartly,“and you are the littlest. A cradle is such a nice homely thing to haveabout a house.”While she sewed they played around her; such a group of happy faces and dancinglimbs lit up by that romantic fire. It had become a very familiar scene, this,in the home under the ground, but we are looking on it for the last time.There was a step above, and Wendy, you may be sure, was the first to recognizeit.“Children, I hear your father’s step. He likes you to meet him atthe door.”Above, the redskins crouched before Peter.“Watch well, braves. I have spoken.”And then, as so often before, the gay children dragged him from his tree. As sooften before, but never again.He had brought nuts for the boys as well as the correct time for Wendy.“Peter, you just spoil them, you know,” Wendy simpered.“Ah, old lady,” said Peter, hanging up his gun.“It was me told him mothers are called old lady,” Michael whisperedto Curly.“I complain of Michael,” said Curly instantly.The first twin came to Peter. “Father, we want to dance.”“Dance away, my little man,” said Peter, who was in high goodhumour.“But we want you to dance.”Peter was really the best dancer among them, but he pretended to bescandalised.“Me! My old bones would rattle!”“And mummy too.”“What,” cried Wendy, “the mother of such an armful,dance!”“But on a Saturday night,” Slightly insinuated.It was not really Saturday night, at least it may have been, for they had longlost count of the days; but always if they wanted to do anything special theysaid this was Saturday night, and then they did it.“Of course it is Saturday night, Peter,” Wendy said, relenting.“People of our figure, Wendy!”“But it is only among our own progeny.”“True, true.”So they were told they could dance, but they must put on their nighties first.“Ah, old lady,” Peter said aside to Wendy, warming himself by thefire and looking down at her as she sat turning a heel, “there is nothingmore pleasant of an evening for you and me when the day’s toil is overthan to rest by the fire with the little ones near by.”“It is sweet, Peter, isn’t it?” Wendy said, frightfullygratified. “Peter, I think Curly has your nose.”“Michael takes after you.”She went to him and put her hand on his shoulder.“Dear Peter,” she said, “with such a large family, of course,I have now passed my best, but you don’t want to change me, doyou?”“No, Wendy.”Certainly he did not want a change, but he looked at her uncomfortably,blinking, you know, like one not sure whether he was awake or asleep.“Peter, what is it?”“I was just thinking,” he said, a little scared. “It is onlymake-believe, isn’t it, that I am their father?”“Oh yes,” Wendy said primly.“You see,” he continued apologetically, “it would make meseem so old to be their real father.”“But they are ours, Peter, yours and mine.”“But not really, Wendy?” he asked anxiously.“Not if you don’t wish it,” she replied; and she distinctlyheard his sigh of relief. “Peter,” she asked, trying to speakfirmly, “what are your exact feelings to me?”“Those of a devoted son, Wendy.”“I thought so,” she said, and went and sat by herself at theextreme end of the room.“You are so queer,” he said, frankly puzzled, “and Tiger Lilyis just the same. There is something she wants to be to me, but she says it isnot my mother.”“No, indeed, it is not,” Wendy replied with frightful emphasis. Nowwe know why she was prejudiced against the redskins.“Then what is it?”“It isn’t for a lady to tell.”“Oh, very well,” Peter said, a little nettled. “PerhapsTinker Bell will tell me.”“Oh yes, Tinker Bell will tell you,” Wendy retorted scornfully.“She is an abandoned little creature.”Here Tink, who was in her bedroom, eavesdropping, squeaked out somethingimpudent.“She says she glories in being abandoned,” Peter interpreted.He had a sudden idea. “Perhaps Tink wants to be my mother?”“You silly ass!” cried Tinker Bell in a passion.She had said it so often that Wendy needed no translation.“I almost agree with her,” Wendy snapped. Fancy Wendy snapping! Butshe had been much tried, and she little knew what was to happen before thenight was out. If she had known she would not have snapped.None of them knew. Perhaps it was best not to know. Their ignorance gave themone more glad hour; and as it was to be their last hour on the island, let usrejoice that there were sixty glad minutes in it. They sang and danced in theirnight-gowns. Such a deliciously creepy song it was, in which they pretended tobe frightened at their own shadows, little witting that so soon shadows wouldclose in upon them, from whom they would shrink in real fear. So uproariouslygay was the dance, and how they buffeted each other on the bed and out of it!It was a pillow fight rather than a dance, and when it was finished, thepillows insisted on one bout more, like partners who know that they may nevermeet again. The stories they told, before it was time for Wendy’sgood-night story! Even Slightly tried to tell a story that night, but thebeginning was so fearfully dull that it appalled not only the others buthimself, and he said gloomily:“Yes, it is a dull beginning. I say, let us pretend that it is theend.”And then at last they all got into bed for Wendy’s story, the story theyloved best, the story Peter hated. Usually when she began to tell this story heleft the room or put his hands over his ears; and possibly if he had doneeither of those things this time they might all still be on the island. Butto-night he remained on his stool; and we shall see what happened."

She is not dead, is she?”“Oh, no.”“I am awfully glad she isn’t dead,” said Tootles. “Areyou glad, John?”“Of course I am.”“Are you glad, Nibs?”“Rather.”“Are you glad, Twins?”“We are glad.”“Oh dear,” sighed Wendy.“Little less noise there,” Peter called out, determined that sheshould have fair play, however beastly a story it might be in his opinion.“The gentleman’s name,” Wendy continued, “was Mr.Darling, and her name was Mrs. Darling.”“I knew them,” John said, to annoy the others.“I think I knew them,” said Michael rather doubtfully.“They were married, you know,” explained Wendy, “and what doyou think they had?”“White rats,” cried Nibs, inspired.“No.”“It’s awfully puzzling,” said Tootles, who knew the story byheart.“Quiet, Tootles. They had three descendants.”“What is descendants?”“Well, you are one, Twin.”“Did you hear that, John? I am a descendant.”“Descendants are only children,” said John.“Oh dear, oh dear,” sighed Wendy. “Now these three childrenhad a faithful nurse called Nana; but Mr. Darling was angry with her andchained her up in the yard, and so all the children flew away.”“It’s an awfully good story,” said Nibs.“They flew away,” Wendy continued, “to the Neverland, wherethe lost children are.”“I just thought they did,” Curly broke in excitedly. “Idon’t know how it is, but I just thought they did!”“O Wendy,” cried Tootles, “was one of the lost childrencalled Tootles?”“Yes, he was.”“I am in a story. Hurrah, I am in a story, Nibs.”“Hush. Now I want you to consider the feelings of the unhappy parentswith all their children flown away.”“Oo!” they all moaned, though they were not really considering thefeelings of the unhappy parents one jot.“Think of the empty beds!”“Oo!”“It’s awfully sad,” the first twin said cheerfully.“I don’t see how it can have a happy ending,” said the secondtwin. “Do you, Nibs?”“I’m frightfully anxious.”“If you knew how great is a mother’s love,” Wendy told themtriumphantly, “you would have no fear.” She had now come to thepart that Peter hated.“I do like a mother’s love,” said Tootles, hitting Nibs witha pillow. “Do you like a mother’s love, Nibs?”“I do just,” said Nibs, hitting back.“You see,” Wendy said complacently, “our heroine knew thatthe mother would always leave the window open for her children to fly back by;so they stayed away for years and had a lovely time.”“Did they ever go back?”“Let us now,” said Wendy, bracing herself up for her finest effort,“take a peep into the future;” and they all gave themselves thetwist that makes peeps into the future easier. “Years have rolled by, andwho is this elegant lady of uncertain age alighting at London Station?”“O Wendy, who is she?” cried Nibs, every bit as excited as if hedidn’t know.“Can it be—yes—no—it is—the fair Wendy!”“Oh!”“And who are the two noble portly figures accompanying her, now grown toman’s estate? Can they be John and Michael? They are!”“Oh!”“‘See, dear brothers,’ says Wendy pointing upwards,‘there is the window still standing open. Ah, now we are rewarded for oursublime faith in a mother’s love.’ So up they flew to their mummyand daddy, and pen cannot describe the happy scene, over which we draw aveil.”That was the story, and they were as pleased with it as the fair narratorherself. Everything just as it should be, you see. Off we skip like the mostheartless things in the world, which is what children are, but so attractive;and we have an entirely selfish time, and then when we have need of specialattention we nobly return for it, confident that we shall be rewarded insteadof smacked.So great indeed was their faith in a mother’s love that they felt theycould afford to be callous for a bit longer.But there was one there who knew better, and when Wendy finished he uttered ahollow groan.“What is it, Peter?” she cried, running to him, thinking he wasill. She felt him solicitously, lower down than his chest. “Where is it,Peter?”“It isn’t that kind of pain,” Peter replied darkly.“Then what kind is it?”“Wendy, you are wrong about mothers.”They all gathered round him in affright, so alarming was his agitation; andwith a fine candour he told them what he had hitherto concealed.“Long ago,” he said, “I thought like you that my mother wouldalways keep the window open for me, so I stayed away for moons and moons andmoons, and then flew back; but the window was barred, for mother had forgottenall about me, and there was another little boy sleeping in my bed.”I am not sure that this was true, but Peter thought it was true; and it scaredthem.“Are you sure mothers are like that?”“Yes.”So this was the truth about mothers. The toads!Still it is best to be careful; and no one knows so quickly as a child when heshould give in. “Wendy, let us go home,” cried John and Michaeltogether.“Yes,” she said, clutching them.“Not to-night?” asked the lost boys bewildered. They knew in whatthey called their hearts that one can get on quite well without a mother, andthat it is only the mothers who think you can’t.“At once,” Wendy replied resolutely, for the horrible thought hadcome to her: “Perhaps mother is in half mourning by this time.”This dread made her forgetful of what must be Peter’s feelings, and shesaid to him rather sharply, “Peter, will you make the necessaryarrangements?”“If you wish it,” he replied, as coolly as if she had asked him topass the nuts.Not so much as a sorry-to-lose-you between them! If she did not mind theparting, he was going to show her, was Peter, that neither did he.But of course he cared very much; and he was so full of wrath againstgrown-ups, who, as usual, were spoiling everything, that as soon as he gotinside his tree he breathed intentionally quick short breaths at the rate ofabout five to a second. He did this because there is a saying in the Neverlandthat, every time you breathe, a grown-up dies; and Peter was killing them offvindictively as fast as possible.Then having given the necessary instructions to the redskins he returned to thehome, where an unworthy scene had been enacted in his absence. Panic-strickenat the thought of losing Wendy the lost boys had advanced upon herthreateningly.“It will be worse than before she came,” they cried.“We shan’t let her go.”“Let’s keep her prisoner.”“Ay, chain her up.”In her extremity an instinct told her to which of them to turn.“Tootles,” she cried, “I appeal to you.”Was it not strange? She appealed to Tootles, quite the silliest one.Grandly, however, did Tootles respond. For that one moment he dropped hissilliness and spoke with dignity.“I am just Tootles,” he said, “and nobody minds me. But thefirst who does not behave to Wendy like an English gentleman I will blood himseverely.”He drew back his hanger; and for that instant his sun was at noon. The othersheld back uneasily. Then Peter returned, and they saw at once that they wouldget no support from him. He would keep no girl in the Neverland against herwill.“Wendy,” he said, striding up and down, “I have asked theredskins to guide you through the wood, as flying tires you so.”“Thank you, Peter.”“Then,” he continued, in the short sharp voice of one accustomed tobe obeyed, “Tinker Bell will take you across the sea. Wake her,Nibs.”Nibs had to knock twice before he got an answer, though Tink had really beensitting up in bed listening for some time.“Who are you? How dare you? Go away,” she cried.“You are to get up, Tink,” Nibs called, “and take Wendy on ajourney.”Of course Tink had been delighted to hear that Wendy was going; but she wasjolly well determined not to be her courier, and she said so in still moreoffensive language. Then she pretended to be asleep again.“She says she won’t!” Nibs exclaimed, aghast at suchinsubordination, whereupon Peter went sternly toward the young lady’schamber.“Tink,” he rapped out, “if you don’t get up and dressat once I will open the curtains, and then we shall all see you in yournegligée.”This made her leap to the floor. “Who said I wasn’t gettingup?” she cried.In the meantime the boys were gazing very forlornly at Wendy, now equipped withJohn and Michael for the journey. By this time they were dejected, not merelybecause they were about to lose her, but also because they felt that she wasgoing off to something nice to which they had not been invited. Novelty wasbeckoning to them as usual.Crediting them with a nobler feeling Wendy melted.“Dear ones,” she said, “if you will all come with me I feelalmost sure I can get my father and mother to adopt you.”The invitation was meant specially for Peter, but each of the boys was thinkingexclusively of himself, and at once they jumped with joy.“But won’t they think us rather a handful?” Nibs asked in themiddle of his jump.“Oh no,” said Wendy, rapidly thinking it out, “it will onlymean having a few beds in the drawing-room; they can be hidden behind thescreens on first Thursdays.”“Peter, can we go?” they all cried imploringly. They took it forgranted that if they went he would go also, but really they scarcely cared.Thus children are ever ready, when novelty knocks, to desert their dearestones.“All right,” Peter replied with a bitter smile, and immediatelythey rushed to get their things.“And now, Peter,” Wendy said, thinking she had put everythingright, “I am going to give you your medicine before you go.” Sheloved to give them medicine, and undoubtedly gave them too much. Of course itwas only water, but it was out of a bottle, and she always shook the bottle andcounted the drops, which gave it a certain medicinal quality. On this occasion,however, she did not give Peter his draught, for just as she had prepared it,she saw a look on his face that made her heart sink.“Get your things, Peter,” she cried, shaking.“No,” he answered, pretending indifference, “I am not goingwith you, Wendy.”“Yes, Peter.”“No.”To show that her departure would leave him unmoved, he skipped up and down theroom, playing gaily on his heartless pipes. She had to run about after him,though it was rather undignified.“To find your mother,” she coaxed.Now, if Peter had ever quite had a mother, he no longer missed her. He could dovery well without one. He had thought them out, and remembered only their badpoints.“No, no,” he told Wendy decisively; “perhaps she would say Iwas old, and I just want always to be a little boy and to have fun.”“But, Peter—”“No.”And so the others had to be told.“Peter isn’t coming.”Peter not coming! They gazed blankly at him, their sticks over their backs, andon each stick a bundle. Their first thought was that if Peter was not going hehad probably changed his mind about letting them go.But he was far too proud for that. “If you find your mothers,” hesaid darkly, “I hope you will like them.”The awful cynicism of this made an uncomfortable impression, and most of thembegan to look rather doubtful. After all, their faces said, were they notnoodles to want to go?“Now then,” cried Peter, “no fuss, no blubbering; good-bye,Wendy;” and he held out his hand cheerily, quite as if they must reallygo now, for he had something important to do.She had to take his hand, and there was no indication that he would prefer athimble.“You will remember about changing your flannels, Peter?” she said,lingering over him. She was always so particular about their flannels.“Yes.”“And you will take your medicine?”“Yes.”That seemed to be everything, and an awkward pause followed. Peter, however,was not the kind that breaks down before other people. “Are you ready,Tinker Bell?” he called out.“Ay, ay.”“Then lead the way.”Tink darted up the nearest tree; but no one followed her, for it was at thismoment that the pirates made their dreadful attack upon the redskins. Above,where all had been so still, the air was rent with shrieks and the clash ofsteel. Below, there was dead silence. Mouths opened and remained open. Wendyfell on her knees, but her arms were extended toward Peter. All arms wereextended to him, as if suddenly blown in his direction; they were beseechinghim mutely not to desert them. As for Peter, he seized his sword, the same hethought he had slain Barbecue with, and the lust of battle was in his eye."

Thewhite men have in the meantime made a rude stockade on the summit of yonderundulating ground, at the foot of which a stream runs, for it is destruction tobe too far from water. There they await the onslaught, the inexperienced onesclutching their revolvers and treading on twigs, but the old hands sleepingtranquilly until just before the dawn. Through the long black night the savagescouts wriggle, snake-like, among the grass without stirring a blade. Thebrushwood closes behind them, as silently as sand into which a mole has dived.Not a sound is to be heard, save when they give vent to a wonderful imitationof the lonely call of the coyote. The cry is answered by other braves; and someof them do it even better than the coyotes, who are not very good at it. So thechill hours wear on, and the long suspense is horribly trying to the palefacewho has to live through it for the first time; but to the trained hand thoseghastly calls and still ghastlier silences are but an intimation of how thenight is marching.That this was the usual procedure was so well known to Hook that indisregarding it he cannot be excused on the plea of ignorance.The Piccaninnies, on their part, trusted implicitly to his honour, and theirwhole action of the night stands out in marked contrast to his. They leftnothing undone that was consistent with the reputation of their tribe. Withthat alertness of the senses which is at once the marvel and despair ofcivilised peoples, they knew that the pirates were on the island from themoment one of them trod on a dry stick; and in an incredibly short space oftime the coyote cries began. Every foot of ground between the spot where Hookhad landed his forces and the home under the trees was stealthily examined bybraves wearing their mocassins with the heels in front. They found only onehillock with a stream at its base, so that Hook had no choice; here he mustestablish himself and wait for just before the dawn. Everything being thusmapped out with almost diabolical cunning, the main body of the redskins foldedtheir blankets around them, and in the phlegmatic manner that is to them, thepearl of manhood squatted above the children’s home, awaiting the coldmoment when they should deal pale death.Here dreaming, though wide-awake, of the exquisite tortures to which they wereto put him at break of day, those confiding savages were found by thetreacherous Hook. From the accounts afterwards supplied by such of the scoutsas escaped the carnage, he does not seem even to have paused at the risingground, though it is certain that in that grey light he must have seen it: nothought of waiting to be attacked appears from first to last to have visitedhis subtle mind; he would not even hold off till the night was nearly spent; onhe pounded with no policy but to fall to. What could the bewildered scouts do,masters as they were of every war-like artifice save this one, but trothelplessly after him, exposing themselves fatally to view, while they gavepathetic utterance to the coyote cry.Around the brave Tiger Lily were a dozen of her stoutest warriors, and theysuddenly saw the perfidious pirates bearing down upon them. Fell from theireyes then the film through which they had looked at victory. No more would theytorture at the stake. For them the happy hunting-grounds was now. They knew it;but as their father’s sons they acquitted themselves. Even then they hadtime to gather in a phalanx that would have been hard to break had they risenquickly, but this they were forbidden to do by the traditions of their race. Itis written that the noble savage must never express surprise in the presence ofthe white. Thus terrible as the sudden appearance of the pirates must have beento them, they remained stationary for a moment, not a muscle moving; as if thefoe had come by invitation. Then, indeed, the tradition gallantly upheld, theyseized their weapons, and the air was torn with the war-cry; but it was now toolate.It is no part of ours to describe what was a massacre rather than a fight. Thusperished many of the flower of the Piccaninny tribe. Not all unavenged did theydie, for with Lean Wolf fell Alf Mason, to disturb the Spanish Main no more,and among others who bit the dust were Geo. Scourie, Chas. Turley, and theAlsatian Foggerty. Turley fell to the tomahawk of the terrible Panther, whoultimately cut a way through the pirates with Tiger Lily and a small remnant ofthe tribe.To what extent Hook is to blame for his tactics on this occasion is for thehistorian to decide. Had he waited on the rising ground till the proper hour heand his men would probably have been butchered; and in judging him it is onlyfair to take this into account. What he should perhaps have done was toacquaint his opponents that he proposed to follow a new method. On the otherhand, this, as destroying the element of surprise, would have made his strategyof no avail, so that the whole question is beset with difficulties. One cannotat least withhold a reluctant admiration for the wit that had conceived so bolda scheme, and the fell genius with which it was carried out.What were his own feelings about himself at that triumphant moment? Fain wouldhis dogs have known, as breathing heavily and wiping their cutlasses, theygathered at a discreet distance from his hook, and squinted through theirferret eyes at this extraordinary man. Elation must have been in his heart, buthis face did not reflect it: ever a dark and solitary enigma, he stood alooffrom his followers in spirit as in substance.The night’s work was not yet over, for it was not the redskins he hadcome out to destroy; they were but the bees to be smoked, so that he should getat the honey. It was Pan he wanted, Pan and Wendy and their band, but chieflyPan.Peter was such a small boy that one tends to wonder at the man’s hatredof him. True he had flung Hook’s arm to the crocodile, but even this andthe increased insecurity of life to which it led, owing to thecrocodile’s pertinacity, hardly account for a vindictiveness sorelentless and malignant. The truth is that there was a something about Peterwhich goaded the pirate captain to frenzy. It was not his courage, it was nothis engaging appearance, it was not—. There is no beating about the bush,for we know quite well what it was, and have got to tell. It was Peter’scockiness.This had got on Hook’s nerves; it made his iron claw twitch, and at nightit disturbed him like an insect. While Peter lived, the tortured man felt thathe was a lion in a cage into which a sparrow had come.The question now was how to get down the trees, or how to get his dogs down? Heran his greedy eyes over them, searching for the thinnest ones. They wriggleduncomfortably, for they knew he would not scruple to ram them down with poles.In the meantime, what of the boys? We have seen them at the first clang of theweapons, turned as it were into stone figures, open-mouthed, all appealing withoutstretched arms to Peter; and we return to them as their mouths close, andtheir arms fall to their sides. The pandemonium above has ceased almost assuddenly as it arose, passed like a fierce gust of wind; but they know that inthe passing it has determined their fate.Which side had won?The pirates, listening avidly at the mouths of the trees, heard the questionput by every boy, and alas, they also heard Peter’s answer.“If the redskins have won,” he said, “they will beat thetom-tom; it is always their sign of victory.”Now Smee had found the tom-tom, and was at that moment sitting on it.“You will never hear the tom-tom again,” he muttered, but inaudiblyof course, for strict silence had been enjoined. To his amazement Hook signedhim to beat the tom-tom, and slowly there came to Smee an understanding of thedreadful wickedness of the order. Never, probably, had this simple man admiredHook so much.Twice Smee beat upon the instrument, and then stopped to listen gleefully.“The tom-tom,” the miscreants heard Peter cry; “an Indianvictory!”The doomed children answered with a cheer that was music to the black heartsabove, and almost immediately they repeated their good-byes to Peter. Thispuzzled the pirates, but all their other feelings were swallowed by a basedelight that the enemy were about to come up the trees. They smirked at eachother and rubbed their hands. Rapidly and silently Hook gave his orders: oneman to each tree, and the others to arrange themselves in a line two yardsapart."

The first to emergefrom his tree was Curly. He rose out of it into the arms of Cecco, who flunghim to Smee, who flung him to Starkey, who flung him to Bill Jukes, who flunghim to Noodler, and so he was tossed from one to another till he fell at thefeet of the black pirate. All the boys were plucked from their trees in thisruthless manner; and several of them were in the air at a time, like bales ofgoods flung from hand to hand.A different treatment was accorded to Wendy, who came last. With ironicalpoliteness Hook raised his hat to her, and, offering her his arm, escorted herto the spot where the others were being gagged. He did it with such an air, hewas so frightfully distingué, that she was too fascinated to cry out.She was only a little girl.Perhaps it is tell-tale to divulge that for a moment Hook entranced her, and wetell on her only because her slip led to strange results. Had she haughtilyunhanded him (and we should have loved to write it of her), she would have beenhurled through the air like the others, and then Hook would probably not havebeen present at the tying of the children; and had he not been at the tying hewould not have discovered Slightly’s secret, and without the secret hecould not presently have made his foul attempt on Peter’s life.They were tied to prevent their flying away, doubled up with their knees closeto their ears; and for the trussing of them the black pirate had cut a ropeinto nine equal pieces. All went well until Slightly’s turn came, when hewas found to be like those irritating parcels that use up all the string ingoing round and leave no tags with which to tie a knot. The pirates kicked himin their rage, just as you kick the parcel (though in fairness you should kickthe string); and strange to say it was Hook who told them to belay theirviolence. His lip was curled with malicious triumph. While his dogs were merelysweating because every time they tried to pack the unhappy lad tight in onepart he bulged out in another, Hook’s master mind had gone far beneathSlightly’s surface, probing not for effects but for causes; and hisexultation showed that he had found them. Slightly, white to the gills, knewthat Hook had surprised his secret, which was this, that no boy so blown outcould use a tree wherein an average man need stick. Poor Slightly, mostwretched of all the children now, for he was in a panic about Peter, bitterlyregretted what he had done. Madly addicted to the drinking of water when he washot, he had swelled in consequence to his present girth, and instead ofreducing himself to fit his tree he had, unknown to the others, whittled histree to make it fit him.Sufficient of this Hook guessed to persuade him that Peter at last lay at hismercy, but no word of the dark design that now formed in the subterraneancaverns of his mind crossed his lips; he merely signed that the captives wereto be conveyed to the ship, and that he would be alone.How to convey them? Hunched up in their ropes they might indeed be rolled downhill like barrels, but most of the way lay through a morass. Again Hook’sgenius surmounted difficulties. He indicated that the little house must be usedas a conveyance. The children were flung into it, four stout pirates raised iton their shoulders, the others fell in behind, and singing the hateful piratechorus the strange procession set off through the wood. I don’t knowwhether any of the children were crying; if so, the singing drowned the sound;but as the little house disappeared in the forest, a brave though tiny jet ofsmoke issued from its chimney as if defying Hook.Hook saw it, and it did Peter a bad service. It dried up any trickle of pityfor him that may have remained in the pirate’s infuriated breast.The first thing he did on finding himself alone in the fast falling night wasto tiptoe to Slightly’s tree, and make sure that it provided him with apassage. Then for long he remained brooding; his hat of ill omen on the sward,so that any gentle breeze which had arisen might play refreshingly through hishair. Dark as were his thoughts his blue eyes were as soft as the periwinkle.Intently he listened for any sound from the nether world, but all was as silentbelow as above; the house under the ground seemed to be but one more emptytenement in the void. Was that boy asleep, or did he stand waiting at the footof Slightly’s tree, with his dagger in his hand?There was no way of knowing, save by going down. Hook let his cloak slip softlyto the ground, and then biting his lips till a lewd blood stood on them, hestepped into the tree. He was a brave man, but for a moment he had to stopthere and wipe his brow, which was dripping like a candle. Then, silently, helet himself go into the unknown.He arrived unmolested at the foot of the shaft, and stood still again, bitingat his breath, which had almost left him. As his eyes became accustomed to thedim light various objects in the home under the trees took shape; but the onlyone on which his greedy gaze rested, long sought for and found at last, was thegreat bed. On the bed lay Peter fast asleep.Unaware of the tragedy being enacted above, Peter had continued, for a littletime after the children left, to play gaily on his pipes: no doubt rather aforlorn attempt to prove to himself that he did not care. Then he decided notto take his medicine, so as to grieve Wendy. Then he lay down on the bedoutside the coverlet, to vex her still more; for she had always tucked theminside it, because you never know that you may not grow chilly at the turn ofthe night. Then he nearly cried; but it struck him how indignant she would beif he laughed instead; so he laughed a haughty laugh and fell asleep in themiddle of it.Sometimes, though not often, he had dreams, and they were more painful than thedreams of other boys. For hours he could not be separated from these dreams,though he wailed piteously in them. They had to do, I think, with the riddle ofhis existence. At such times it had been Wendy’s custom to take him outof bed and sit with him on her lap, soothing him in dear ways of her owninvention, and when he grew calmer to put him back to bed before he quite wokeup, so that he should not know of the indignity to which she had subjected him.But on this occasion he had fallen at once into a dreamless sleep. One armdropped over the edge of the bed, one leg was arched, and the unfinished partof his laugh was stranded on his mouth, which was open, showing the littlepearls.Thus defenceless Hook found him. He stood silent at the foot of the treelooking across the chamber at his enemy. Did no feeling of compassion disturbhis sombre breast? The man was not wholly evil; he loved flowers (I have beentold) and sweet music (he was himself no mean performer on the harpsichord);and, let it be frankly admitted, the idyllic nature of the scene stirred himprofoundly. Mastered by his better self he would have returned reluctantly upthe tree, but for one thing.What stayed him was Peter’s impertinent appearance as he slept. The openmouth, the drooping arm, the arched knee: they were such a personification ofcockiness as, taken together, will never again, one may hope, be presented toeyes so sensitive to their offensiveness. They steeled Hook’s heart. Ifhis rage had broken him into a hundred pieces every one of them would havedisregarded the incident, and leapt at the sleeper.Though a light from the one lamp shone dimly on the bed, Hook stood in darknesshimself, and at the first stealthy step forward he discovered an obstacle, thedoor of Slightly’s tree. It did not entirely fill the aperture, and hehad been looking over it. Feeling for the catch, he found to his fury that itwas low down, beyond his reach. To his disordered brain it seemed then that theirritating quality in Peter’s face and figure visibly increased, and herattled the door and flung himself against it. Was his enemy to escape himafter all?But what was that? The red in his eye had caught sight of Peter’smedicine standing on a ledge within easy reach. He fathomed what it wasstraightaway, and immediately knew that the sleeper was in his power.Lest he should be taken alive, Hook always carried about his person a dreadfuldrug, blended by himself of all the death-dealing rings that had come into hispossession. These he had boiled down into a yellow liquid quite unknown toscience, which was probably the most virulent poison in existence.Five drops of this he now added to Peter’s cup. His hand shook, but itwas in exultation rather than in shame. As he did it he avoided glancing at thesleeper, but not lest pity should unnerve him; merely to avoid spilling. Thenone long gloating look he cast upon his victim, and turning, wormed his waywith difficulty up the tree. As he emerged at the top he looked the very spiritof evil breaking from its hole. Donning his hat at its most rakish angle, hewound his cloak around him, holding one end in front as if to conceal hisperson from the night, of which it was the blackest part, and mutteringstrangely to himself, stole away through the trees.Peter slept on. The light guttered and went out, leaving the tenement indarkness; but still he slept. It must have been not less than ten o’clockby the crocodile, when he suddenly sat up in his bed, wakened by he knew notwhat. It was a soft cautious tapping on the door of his tree.Soft and cautious, but in that stillness it was sinister. Peter felt for hisdagger till his hand gripped it. Then he spoke.“Who is that?”For long there was no answer: then again the knock.“Who are you?”No answer.He was thrilled, and he loved being thrilled. In two strides he reached thedoor. Unlike Slightly’s door, it filled the aperture, so that he couldnot see beyond it, nor could the one knocking see him.“I won’t open unless you speak,” Peter cried.Then at last the visitor spoke, in a lovely bell-like voice.“Let me in, Peter.”It was Tink, and quickly he unbarred to her. She flew in excitedly, her faceflushed and her dress stained with mud.“What is it?”“Oh, you could never guess!” she cried, and offered him threeguesses. “Out with it!” he shouted, and in one ungrammaticalsentence, as long as the ribbons that conjurers pull from their mouths, shetold of the capture of Wendy and the boys.Peter’s heart bobbed up and down as he listened. Wendy bound, and on thepirate ship; she who loved everything to be just so!“I’ll rescue her!” he cried, leaping at his weapons. As heleapt he thought of something he could do to please her. He could take hismedicine.His hand closed on the fatal draught.“No!” shrieked Tinker Bell, who had heard Hook mutter about hisdeed as he sped through the forest.“Why not?”“It is poisoned.”“Poisoned? Who could have poisoned it?”“Hook.”“Don’t be silly. How could Hook have got down here?”Alas, Tinker Bell could not explain this, for even she did not know the darksecret of Slightly’s tree. Nevertheless Hook’s words had left noroom for doubt. The cup was poisoned.“Besides,” said Peter, quite believing himself, “I never fellasleep.”He raised the cup. No time for words now; time for deeds; and with one of herlightning movements Tink got between his lips and the draught, and drained itto the dregs.“Why, Tink, how dare you drink my medicine?”But she did not answer. Already she was reeling in the air.“What is the matter with you?” cried Peter, suddenly afraid.“It was poisoned, Peter,” she told him softly; “and now I amgoing to be dead.”“O Tink, did you drink it to save me?”“Yes.”“But why, Tink?”Her wings would scarcely carry her now, but in reply she alighted on hisshoulder and gave his nose a loving bite. She whispered in his ear “Yousilly ass,” and then, tottering to her chamber, lay down on the bed.His head almost filled the fourth wall of her little room as he knelt near herin distress. Every moment her light was growing fainter; and he knew that if itwent out she would be no more. She liked his tears so much that she put out herbeautiful finger and let them run over it.Her voice was so low that at first he could not make out what she said. Then hemade it out. She was saying that she thought she could get well again ifchildren believed in fairies.Peter flung out his arms. There were no children there, and it was night time;but he addressed all who might be dreaming of the Neverland, and who weretherefore nearer to him than you think: boys and girls in their nighties, andnaked papooses in their baskets hung from trees.“Do you believe?” he cried.Tink sat up in bed almost briskly to listen to her fate.She fancied she heard answers in the affirmative, and then again shewasn’t sure.“What do you think?” she asked Peter.“If you believe,” he shouted to them, “clap your hands;don’t let Tink die.”Many clapped.Some didn’t.A few beasts hissed.The clapping stopped suddenly; as if countless mothers had rushed to theirnurseries to see what on earth was happening; but already Tink was saved. Firsther voice grew strong, then she popped out of bed, then she was flashingthrough the room more merry and impudent than ever. She never thought ofthanking those who believed, but she would have liked to get at the ones whohad hissed.“And now to rescue Wendy!”The moon was riding in a cloudy heaven when Peter rose from his tree, begirtwith weapons and wearing little else, to set out upon his perilous quest. Itwas not such a night as he would have chosen. He had hoped to fly, keeping notfar from the ground so that nothing unwonted should escape his eyes; but inthat fitful light to have flown low would have meant trailing his shadowthrough the trees, thus disturbing birds and acquainting a watchful foe that hewas astir.He regretted now that he had given the birds of the island such strange namesthat they are very wild and difficult of approach.There was no other course but to press forward in redskin fashion, at whichhappily he was an adept. But in what direction, for he could not be sure thatthe children had been taken to the ship? A light fall of snow had obliteratedall footmarks; and a deathly silence pervaded the island, as if for a spaceNature stood still in horror of the recent carnage. He had taught the childrensomething of the forest lore that he had himself learned from Tiger Lily andTinker Bell, and knew that in their dire hour they were not likely to forgetit. Slightly, if he had an opportunity, would blaze the trees, for instance,Curly would drop seeds, and Wendy would leave her handkerchief at someimportant place. The morning was needed to search for such guidance, and hecould not wait. The upper world had called him, but would give no help.The crocodile passed him, but not another living thing, not a sound, not amovement; and yet he knew well that sudden death might be at the next tree, orstalking him from behind.He swore this terrible oath: “Hook or me this time.”Now he crawled forward like a snake, and again erect, he darted across a spaceon which the moonlight played, one finger on his lip and his dagger at theready. He was frightfully happy."

",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,THE PIRATE SHIP,"One green light squinting over Kidd’s Creek, which is near the mouth ofthe pirate river, marked where the brig, the Jolly Roger, lay, low inthe water; a rakish-looking craft foul to the hull, every beam in herdetestable, like ground strewn with mangled feathers. She was the cannibal ofthe seas, and scarce needed that watchful eye, for she floated immune in thehorror of her name.She was wrapped in the blanket of night, through which no sound from her couldhave reached the shore. There was little sound, and none agreeable save thewhir of the ship’s sewing machine at which Smee sat, ever industrious andobliging, the essence of the commonplace, pathetic Smee. I know not why he wasso infinitely pathetic, unless it were because he was so pathetically unawareof it; but even strong men had to turn hastily from looking at him, and morethan once on summer evenings he had touched the fount of Hook’s tears andmade it flow. Of this, as of almost everything else, Smee was quiteunconscious.A few of the pirates leant over the bulwarks, drinking in the miasma of thenight; others sprawled by barrels over games of dice and cards; and theexhausted four who had carried the little house lay prone on the deck, whereeven in their sleep they rolled skillfully to this side or that out ofHook’s reach, lest he should claw them mechanically in passing.Hook trod the deck in thought. O man unfathomable. It was his hour of triumph.Peter had been removed for ever from his path, and all the other boys were inthe brig, about to walk the plank. It was his grimmest deed since the days whenhe had brought Barbecue to heel; and knowing as we do how vain a tabernacle isman, could we be surprised had he now paced the deck unsteadily, bellied out bythe winds of his success?But there was no elation in his gait, which kept pace with the action of hissombre mind. Hook was profoundly dejected.He was often thus when communing with himself on board ship in the quietude ofthe night. It was because he was so terribly alone. This inscrutable man neverfelt more alone than when surrounded by his dogs. They were socially inferiorto him.Hook was not his true name. To reveal who he really was would even at this dateset the country in a blaze; but as those who read between the lines mustalready have guessed, he had been at a famous public school; and its traditionsstill clung to him like garments, with which indeed they are largely concerned.Thus it was offensive to him even now to board a ship in the same dress inwhich he grappled her, and he still adhered in his walk to the school’sdistinguished slouch. But above all he retained the passion for good form.Good form! However much he may have degenerated, he still knew that this is allthat really matters.From far within him he heard a creaking as of rusty portals, and through themcame a stern tap-tap-tap, like hammering in the night when one cannot sleep.“Have you been good form to-day?” was their eternal question.“Fame, fame, that glittering bauble, it is mine,” he cried.“Is it quite good form to be distinguished at anything?” thetap-tap from his school replied.“I am the only man whom Barbecue feared,” he urged, “andFlint feared Barbecue.”“Barbecue, Flint—what house?” came the cutting retort.Most disquieting reflection of all, was it not bad form to think about goodform?His vitals were tortured by this problem. It was a claw within him sharper thanthe iron one; and as it tore him, the perspiration dripped down his tallowcountenance and streaked his doublet. Ofttimes he drew his sleeve across hisface, but there was no damming that trickle.Ah, envy not Hook.There came to him a presentiment of his early dissolution. It was as ifPeter’s terrible oath had boarded the ship. Hook felt a gloomy desire tomake his dying speech, lest presently there should be no time for it.“Better for Hook,” he cried, “if he had had lessambition!” It was in his darkest hours only that he referred to himselfin the third person.“No little children to love me!”Strange that he should think of this, which had never troubled him before;perhaps the sewing machine brought it to his mind. For long he muttered tohimself, staring at Smee, who was hemming placidly, under the conviction thatall children feared him.Feared him! Feared Smee! There was not a child on board the brig that night whodid not already love him. He had said horrid things to them and hit them withthe palm of his hand, because he could not hit with his fist, but they had onlyclung to him the more. Michael had tried on his spectacles.To tell poor Smee that they thought him lovable! Hook itched to do it, but itseemed too brutal. Instead, he revolved this mystery in his mind: why do theyfind Smee lovable? He pursued the problem like the sleuth-hound that he was. IfSmee was lovable, what was it that made him so? A terrible answer suddenlypresented itself—“Good form?”Had the bo’sun good form without knowing it, which is the best form ofall?He remembered that you have to prove you don’t know you have it beforeyou are eligible for Pop.With a cry of rage he raised his iron hand over Smee’s head; but he didnot tear. What arrested him was this reflection:“To claw a man because he is good form, what would that be?”“Bad form!”The unhappy Hook was as impotent as he was damp, and he fell forward like a cutflower.His dogs thinking him out of the way for a time, discipline instantly relaxed;and they broke into a bacchanalian dance, which brought him to his feet atonce, all traces of human weakness gone, as if a bucket of water had passedover him.“Quiet, you scugs,” he cried, “or I’ll cast anchor inyou;” and at once the din was hushed. “Are all the childrenchained, so that they cannot fly away?”“Ay, ay.”“Then hoist them up.”The wretched prisoners were dragged from the hold, all except Wendy, and rangedin line in front of him. For a time he seemed unconscious of their presence. Helolled at his ease, humming, not unmelodiously, snatches of a rude song, andfingering a pack of cards. Ever and anon the light from his cigar gave a touchof colour to his face.“Now then, bullies,” he said briskly, “six of you walk theplank to-night, but I have room for two cabin boys. Which of you is it tobe?”“Don’t irritate him unnecessarily,” had been Wendy’sinstructions in the hold; so Tootles stepped forward politely. Tootles hatedthe idea of signing under such a man, but an instinct told him that it would beprudent to lay the responsibility on an absent person; and though a somewhatsilly boy, he knew that mothers alone are always willing to be the buffer. Allchildren know this about mothers, and despise them for it, but make constantuse of it.So Tootles explained prudently, “You see, sir, I don’t think mymother would like me to be a pirate. Would your mother like you to be a pirate,Slightly?”He winked at Slightly, who said mournfully, “I don’t thinkso,” as if he wished things had been otherwise. “Would your motherlike you to be a pirate, Twin?”“I don’t think so,” said the first twin, as clever as theothers. “Nibs, would—”“Stow this gab,” roared Hook, and the spokesmen were dragged back.“You, boy,” he said, addressing John, “you look as if you hada little pluck in you. Didst never want to be a pirate, my hearty?”Now John had sometimes experienced this hankering at maths. prep.; and he wasstruck by Hook’s picking him out.“I once thought of calling myself Red-handed Jack,” he saiddiffidently.“And a good name too. We’ll call you that here, bully, if youjoin.”“What do you think, Michael?” asked John.“What would you call me if I join?” Michael demanded.“Blackbeard Joe.”Michael was naturally impressed. “What do you think, John?” Hewanted John to decide, and John wanted him to decide.“Shall we still be respectful subjects of the King?” John inquired.Through Hook’s teeth came the answer: “You would have to swear,‘Down with the King.’”Perhaps John had not behaved very well so far, but he shone out now.“Then I refuse,” he cried, banging the barrel in front of Hook.“And I refuse,” cried Michael.“Rule Britannia!” squeaked Curly.The infuriated pirates buffeted them in the mouth; and Hook roared out,“That seals your doom. Bring up their mother. Get the plank ready.”They were only boys, and they went white as they saw Jukes and Cecco preparingthe fatal plank. But they tried to look brave when Wendy was brought up.No words of mine can tell you how Wendy despised those pirates. To the boysthere was at least some glamour in the pirate calling; but all that she saw wasthat the ship had not been tidied for years. There was not a porthole on thegrimy glass of which you might not have written with your finger “Dirtypig”; and she had already written it on several. But as the boys gatheredround her she had no thought, of course, save for them.“So, my beauty,” said Hook, as if he spoke in syrup, “you areto see your children walk the plank.”Fine gentlemen though he was, the intensity of his communings had soiled hisruff, and suddenly he knew that she was gazing at it. With a hasty gesture hetried to hide it, but he was too late.“Are they to die?” asked Wendy, with a look of such frightfulcontempt that he nearly fainted.“They are,” he snarled. “Silence all,” he calledgloatingly, “for a mother’s last words to her children.”At this moment Wendy was grand. “These are my last words, dearboys,” she said firmly. “I feel that I have a message to you fromyour real mothers, and it is this: ‘We hope our sons will die likeEnglish gentlemen.’”Even the pirates were awed, and Tootles cried out hysterically, “I amgoing to do what my mother hopes. What are you to do, Nibs?”“What my mother hopes. What are you to do, Twin?”“What my mother hopes. John, what are—”But Hook had found his voice again.“Tie her up!” he shouted.It was Smee who tied her to the mast. “See here, honey,” hewhispered, “I’ll save you if you promise to be my mother.”But not even for Smee would she make such a promise. “I would almostrather have no children at all,” she said disdainfully.It is sad to know that not a boy was looking at her as Smee tied her to themast; the eyes of all were on the plank: that last little walk they were aboutto take. They were no longer able to hope that they would walk it manfully, forthe capacity to think had gone from them; they could stare and shiver only.Hook smiled on them with his teeth closed, and took a step toward Wendy. Hisintention was to turn her face so that she should see the boys walking theplank one by one. But he never reached her, he never heard the cry of anguishhe hoped to wring from her. He heard something else instead.It was the terrible tick-tick of the crocodile.They all heard it—pirates, boys, Wendy; and immediately every head wasblown in one direction; not to the water whence the sound proceeded, but towardHook. All knew that what was about to happen concerned him alone, and that frombeing actors they were suddenly become spectators.Very frightful was it to see the change that came over him. It was as if he hadbeen clipped at every joint. He fell in a little heap.The sound came steadily nearer; and in advance of it came this ghastly thought,“The crocodile is about to board the ship!”Even the iron claw hung inactive; as if knowing that it was no intrinsic partof what the attacking force wanted. Left so fearfully alone, any other manwould have lain with his eyes shut where he fell: but the gigantic brain ofHook was still working, and under its guidance he crawled on the knees alongthe deck as far from the sound as he could go. The pirates respectfully cleareda passage for him, and it was only when he brought up against the bulwarks thathe spoke.“Hide me!” he cried hoarsely.They gathered round him, all eyes averted from the thing that was comingaboard. They had no thought of fighting it. It was Fate.Only when Hook was hidden from them did curiosity loosen the limbs of the boysso that they could rush to the ship’s side to see the crocodile climbingit. Then they got the strangest surprise of the Night of Nights; for it was nocrocodile that was coming to their aid. It was Peter.He signed to them not to give vent to any cry of admiration that might rousesuspicion. Then he went on ticking."

Thus, to take an instance, we suddenly discoverthat we have been deaf in one ear for we don’t know how long, but, say,half an hour. Now such an experience had come that night to Peter. When last wesaw him he was stealing across the island with one finger to his lips and hisdagger at the ready. He had seen the crocodile pass by without noticinganything peculiar about it, but by and by he remembered that it had not beenticking. At first he thought this eerie, but soon concluded rightly that theclock had run down.Without giving a thought to what might be the feelings of a fellow-creaturethus abruptly deprived of its closest companion, Peter began to consider how hecould turn the catastrophe to his own use; and he decided to tick, so that wildbeasts should believe he was the crocodile and let him pass unmolested. Heticked superbly, but with one unforeseen result. The crocodile was among thosewho heard the sound, and it followed him, though whether with the purpose ofregaining what it had lost, or merely as a friend under the belief that it wasagain ticking itself, will never be certainly known, for, like slaves to afixed idea, it was a stupid beast.Peter reached the shore without mishap, and went straight on, his legsencountering the water as if quite unaware that they had entered a new element.Thus many animals pass from land to water, but no other human of whom I know.As he swam he had but one thought: “Hook or me this time.” He hadticked so long that he now went on ticking without knowing that he was doingit. Had he known he would have stopped, for to board the brig by help of thetick, though an ingenious idea, had not occurred to him.On the contrary, he thought he had scaled her side as noiseless as a mouse; andhe was amazed to see the pirates cowering from him, with Hook in their midst asabject as if he had heard the crocodile.The crocodile! No sooner did Peter remember it than he heard the ticking. Atfirst he thought the sound did come from the crocodile, and he looked behindhim swiftly. Then he realised that he was doing it himself, and in a flash heunderstood the situation. “How clever of me!” he thought at once,and signed to the boys not to burst into applause.It was at this moment that Ed Teynte the quartermaster emerged from theforecastle and came along the deck. Now, reader, time what happened by yourwatch. Peter struck true and deep. John clapped his hands on the ill-fatedpirate’s mouth to stifle the dying groan. He fell forward. Four boyscaught him to prevent the thud. Peter gave the signal, and the carrion was castoverboard. There was a splash, and then silence. How long has it taken?“One!” (Slightly had begun to count.)None too soon, Peter, every inch of him on tiptoe, vanished into the cabin; formore than one pirate was screwing up his courage to look round. They could heareach other’s distressed breathing now, which showed them that the moreterrible sound had passed.“It’s gone, captain,” Smee said, wiping off his spectacles.“All’s still again.”Slowly Hook let his head emerge from his ruff, and listened so intently that hecould have caught the echo of the tick. There was not a sound, and he drewhimself up firmly to his full height.“Then here’s to Johnny Plank!” he cried brazenly, hating theboys more than ever because they had seen him unbend. He broke into thevillainous ditty:“Yo ho, yo ho, the frisky plank,You walks along it so,Till it goes down and you goes downTo Davy Jones below!”To terrorise the prisoners the more, though with a certain loss of dignity, hedanced along an imaginary plank, grimacing at them as he sang; and when hefinished he cried, “Do you want a touch of the cat before you walk theplank?”At that they fell on their knees. “No, no!” they cried so piteouslythat every pirate smiled.“Fetch the cat, Jukes,” said Hook; “it’s in thecabin.”The cabin! Peter was in the cabin! The children gazed at each other.“Ay, ay,” said Jukes blithely, and he strode into the cabin. Theyfollowed him with their eyes; they scarce knew that Hook had resumed his song,his dogs joining in with him:“Yo ho, yo ho, the scratching cat,Its tails are nine, you know,And when they’re writ upon your back—”What was the last line will never be known, for of a sudden the song was stayedby a dreadful screech from the cabin. It wailed through the ship, and diedaway. Then was heard a crowing sound which was well understood by the boys, butto the pirates was almost more eerie than the screech.“What was that?” cried Hook.“Two,” said Slightly solemnly.The Italian Cecco hesitated for a moment and then swung into the cabin. Hetottered out, haggard.“What’s the matter with Bill Jukes, you dog?” hissed Hook,towering over him.“The matter wi’ him is he’s dead, stabbed,” repliedCecco in a hollow voice.“Bill Jukes dead!” cried the startled pirates.“The cabin’s as black as a pit,” Cecco said, almostgibbering, “but there is something terrible in there: the thing you heardcrowing.”The exultation of the boys, the lowering looks of the pirates, both were seenby Hook.“Cecco,” he said in his most steely voice, “go back and fetchme out that doodle-doo.”Cecco, bravest of the brave, cowered before his captain, crying “No,no”; but Hook was purring to his claw.“Did you say you would go, Cecco?” he said musingly.Cecco went, first flinging his arms despairingly. There was no more singing,all listened now; and again came a death-screech and again a crow.No one spoke except Slightly. “Three,” he said.Hook rallied his dogs with a gesture. “’S’death and oddsfish,” he thundered, “who is to bring me that doodle-doo?”“Wait till Cecco comes out,” growled Starkey, and the others tookup the cry.“I think I heard you volunteer, Starkey,” said Hook, purring again.“No, by thunder!” Starkey cried.“My hook thinks you did,” said Hook, crossing to him. “Iwonder if it would not be advisable, Starkey, to humour the hook?”“I’ll swing before I go in there,” replied Starkey doggedly,and again he had the support of the crew.“Is this mutiny?” asked Hook more pleasantly than ever.“Starkey’s ringleader!”“Captain, mercy!” Starkey whimpered, all of a tremble now.“Shake hands, Starkey,” said Hook, proffering his claw.Starkey looked round for help, but all deserted him. As he backed up Hookadvanced, and now the red spark was in his eye. With a despairing scream thepirate leapt upon Long Tom and precipitated himself into the sea.“Four,” said Slightly.“And now,” Hook said courteously, “did any other gentlemensay mutiny?” Seizing a lantern and raising his claw with a menacinggesture, “I’ll bring out that doodle-doo myself,” he said,and sped into the cabin.“Five.” How Slightly longed to say it. He wetted his lips to beready, but Hook came staggering out, without his lantern.“Something blew out the light,” he said a little unsteadily.“Something!” echoed Mullins.“What of Cecco?” demanded Noodler.“He’s as dead as Jukes,” said Hook shortly.His reluctance to return to the cabin impressed them all unfavourably, and themutinous sounds again broke forth. All pirates are superstitious, and Cooksoncried, “They do say the surest sign a ship’s accurst is whenthere’s one on board more than can be accounted for.”“I’ve heard,” muttered Mullins, “he always boards thepirate craft last. Had he a tail, captain?”“They say,” said another, looking viciously at Hook, “thatwhen he comes it’s in the likeness of the wickedest man aboard.”“Had he a hook, captain?” asked Cookson insolently; and one afteranother took up the cry, “The ship’s doomed!” At this thechildren could not resist raising a cheer. Hook had well-nigh forgotten hisprisoners, but as he swung round on them now his face lit up again.“Lads,” he cried to his crew, “now here’s a notion.Open the cabin door and drive them in. Let them fight the doodle-doo for theirlives. If they kill him, we’re so much the better; if he kills them,we’re none the worse.”For the last time his dogs admired Hook, and devotedly they did his bidding.The boys, pretending to struggle, were pushed into the cabin and the door wasclosed on them.“Now, listen!” cried Hook, and all listened. But not one dared toface the door. Yes, one, Wendy, who all this time had been bound to the mast.It was for neither a scream nor a crow that she was watching, it was for thereappearance of Peter.She had not long to wait. In the cabin he had found the thing for which he hadgone in search: the key that would free the children of their manacles, and nowthey all stole forth, armed with such weapons as they could find. First signingthem to hide, Peter cut Wendy’s bonds, and then nothing could have beeneasier than for them all to fly off together; but one thing barred the way, anoath, “Hook or me this time.” So when he had freed Wendy, hewhispered for her to conceal herself with the others, and himself took herplace by the mast, her cloak around him so that he should pass for her. Then hetook a great breath and crowed.To the pirates it was a voice crying that all the boys lay slain in the cabin;and they were panic-stricken. Hook tried to hearten them; but like the dogs hehad made them they showed him their fangs, and he knew that if he took his eyesoff them now they would leap at him.“Lads,” he said, ready to cajole or strike as need be, but neverquailing for an instant, “I’ve thought it out. There’s aJonah aboard.”“Ay,” they snarled, “a man wi’ a hook.”“No, lads, no, it’s the girl. Never was luck on a pirate shipwi’ a woman on board. We’ll right the ship when she’sgone.”Some of them remembered that this had been a saying of Flint’s.“It’s worth trying,” they said doubtfully.“Fling the girl overboard,” cried Hook; and they made a rush at thefigure in the cloak.“There’s none can save you now, missy,” Mullins hissedjeeringly.“There’s one,” replied the figure.“Who’s that?”“Peter Pan the avenger!” came the terrible answer; and as he spokePeter flung off his cloak. Then they all knew who ’twas that had beenundoing them in the cabin, and twice Hook essayed to speak and twice he failed.In that frightful moment I think his fierce heart broke.At last he cried, “Cleave him to the brisket!” but withoutconviction.“Down, boys, and at them!” Peter’s voice rang out; and inanother moment the clash of arms was resounding through the ship. Had thepirates kept together it is certain that they would have won; but the onsetcame when they were still unstrung, and they ran hither and thither, strikingwildly, each thinking himself the last survivor of the crew. Man to man theywere the stronger; but they fought on the defensive only, which enabled theboys to hunt in pairs and choose their quarry. Some of the miscreants leaptinto the sea; others hid in dark recesses, where they were found by Slightly,who did not fight, but ran about with a lantern which he flashed in theirfaces, so that they were half blinded and fell as an easy prey to the reekingswords of the other boys. There was little sound to be heard but the clang ofweapons, an occasional screech or splash, and Slightly monotonouslycounting—five—six—seven—eight—nine—ten—eleven.I think all were gone when a group of savage boys surrounded Hook, who seemedto have a charmed life, as he kept them at bay in that circle of fire. They haddone for his dogs, but this man alone seemed to be a match for them all. Againand again they closed upon him, and again and again he hewed a clear space. Hehad lifted up one boy with his hook, and was using him as a buckler, whenanother, who had just passed his sword through Mullins, sprang into the fray.“Put up your swords, boys,” cried the newcomer, “this man ismine.”Thus suddenly Hook found himself face to face with Peter. The others drew backand formed a ring around them.For long the two enemies looked at one another, Hook shuddering slightly, andPeter with the strange smile upon his face.“So, Pan,” said Hook at last, “this is all your doing.”“Ay, James Hook,” came the stern answer, “it is all mydoing.”“Proud and insolent youth,” said Hook, “prepare to meet thydoom.”“Dark and sinister man,” Peter answered, “have atthee.”Without more words they fell to, and for a space there was no advantage toeither blade. Peter was a superb swordsman, and parried with dazzling rapidity;ever and anon he followed up a feint with a lunge that got past his foe’sdefence, but his shorter reach stood him in ill stead, and he could not drivethe steel home. Hook, scarcely his inferior in brilliancy, but not quite sonimble in wrist play, forced him back by the weight of his onset, hopingsuddenly to end all with a favourite thrust, taught him long ago by Barbecue atRio; but to his astonishment he found this thrust turned aside again and again.Then he sought to close and give the quietus with his iron hook, which all thistime had been pawing the air; but Peter doubled under it and, lunging fiercely,pierced him in the ribs. At the sight of his own blood, whose peculiar colour,you remember, was offensive to him, the sword fell from Hook’s hand, andhe was at Peter’s mercy.“Now!” cried all the boys, but with a magnificent gesture Peterinvited his opponent to pick up his sword. Hook did so instantly, but with atragic feeling that Peter was showing good form.Hitherto he had thought it was some fiend fighting him, but darker suspicionsassailed him now.“Pan, who and what art thou?” he cried huskily.“I’m youth, I’m joy,” Peter answered at a venture,“I’m a little bird that has broken out of the egg.”This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peterdid not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle ofgood form.“To’t again,” he cried despairingly.He fought now like a human flail, and every sweep of that terrible sword wouldhave severed in twain any man or boy who obstructed it; but Peter flutteredround him as if the very wind it made blew him out of the danger zone. Andagain and again he darted in and pricked.Hook was fighting now without hope. That passionate breast no longer asked forlife; but for one boon it craved: to see Peter show bad form before it was coldforever.Abandoning the fight he rushed into the powder magazine and fired it.“In two minutes,” he cried, “the ship will be blown topieces.”Now, now, he thought, true form will show.But Peter issued from the powder magazine with the shell in his hands, andcalmly flung it overboard.What sort of form was Hook himself showing? Misguided man though he was, we maybe glad, without sympathising with him, that in the end he was true to thetraditions of his race. The other boys were flying around him now, flouting,scornful; and he staggered about the deck striking up at them impotently, hismind was no longer with them; it was slouching in the playing fields of longago, or being sent up for good, or watching the wall-game from a famous wall.And his shoes were right, and his waistcoat was right, and his tie was right,and his socks were right.James Hook, thou not wholly unheroic figure, farewell.For we have come to his last moment.Seeing Peter slowly advancing upon him through the air with dagger poised, hesprang upon the bulwarks to cast himself into the sea. He did not know that thecrocodile was waiting for him; for we purposely stopped the clock that thisknowledge might be spared him: a little mark of respect from us at the end.He had one last triumph, which I think we need not grudge him. As he stood onthe bulwark looking over his shoulder at Peter gliding through the air, heinvited him with a gesture to use his foot. It made Peter kick instead of stab.At last Hook had got the boon for which he craved.“Bad form,” he cried jeeringly, and went content to the crocodile.Thus perished James Hook.“Seventeen,” Slightly sang out; but he was not quite correct in hisfigures. Fifteen paid the penalty for their crimes that night; but two reachedthe shore: Starkey to be captured by the redskins, who made him nurse for alltheir papooses, a melancholy come-down for a pirate; and Smee, who henceforthwandered about the world in his spectacles, making a precarious living bysaying he was the only man that Jas. Hook had feared.Wendy, of course, had stood by taking no part in the fight, though watchingPeter with glistening eyes; but now that all was over she became prominentagain. She praised them equally, and shuddered delightfully when Michael showedher the place where he had killed one; and then she took them into Hook’scabin and pointed to his watch which was hanging on a nail. It said“half-past one!”The lateness of the hour was almost the biggest thing of all. She got them tobed in the pirates’ bunks pretty quickly, you may be sure; all but Peter,who strutted up and down on the deck, until at last he fell asleep by the sideof Long Tom. He had one of his dreams that night, and cried in his sleep for along time, and Wendy held him tightly."

",この物語は、愛されるキャラクター、ピーター・パンを中心に展開し、ウェンディ・ダーリングという少女とその兄弟、ジョンとマイケルとともに、幻想的なネバーランドでの彼の冒険を描いている,https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/16/pg16.cover.medium.jpg,THE RETURN HOME,"By three bells that morning they were all stirring their stumps; for there wasa big sea running; and Tootles, the bo’sun, was among them, with arope’s end in his hand and chewing tobacco. They all donned pirateclothes cut off at the knee, shaved smartly, and tumbled up, with the truenautical roll and hitching their trousers.It need not be said who was the captain. Nibs and John were first and secondmate. There was a woman aboard. The rest were tars before the mast, and livedin the fo’c’sle. Peter had already lashed himself to the wheel; buthe piped all hands and delivered a short address to them; said he hoped theywould do their duty like gallant hearties, but that he knew they were the scumof Rio and the Gold Coast, and if they snapped at him he would tear them. Thebluff strident words struck the note sailors understood, and they cheered himlustily. Then a few sharp orders were given, and they turned the ship round,and nosed her for the mainland.Captain Pan calculated, after consulting the ship’s chart, that if thisweather lasted they should strike the Azores about the 21st of June, afterwhich it would save time to fly.Some of them wanted it to be an honest ship and others were in favour ofkeeping it a pirate; but the captain treated them as dogs, and they dared notexpress their wishes to him even in a round robin. Instant obedience was theonly safe thing. Slightly got a dozen for looking perplexed when told to takesoundings. The general feeling was that Peter was honest just now to lullWendy’s suspicions, but that there might be a change when the new suitwas ready, which, against her will, she was making for him out of some ofHook’s wickedest garments. It was afterwards whispered among them that onthe first night he wore this suit he sat long in the cabin with Hook’scigar-holder in his mouth and one hand clenched, all but for the forefinger,which he bent and held threateningly aloft like a hook.Instead of watching the ship, however, we must now return to that desolate homefrom which three of our characters had taken heartless flight so long ago. Itseems a shame to have neglected No. 14 all this time; and yet we may be surethat Mrs. Darling does not blame us. If we had returned sooner to look withsorrowful sympathy at her, she would probably have cried, “Don’t besilly; what do I matter? Do go back and keep an eye on the children.” Solong as mothers are like this their children will take advantage of them; andthey may lay to that.Even now we venture into that familiar nursery only because its lawfuloccupants are on their way home; we are merely hurrying on in advance of themto see that their beds are properly aired and that Mr. and Mrs. Darling do notgo out for the evening. We are no more than servants. Why on earth should theirbeds be properly aired, seeing that they left them in such a thankless hurry?Would it not serve them jolly well right if they came back and found that theirparents were spending the week-end in the country? It would be the moral lessonthey have been in need of ever since we met them; but if we contrived things inthis way Mrs. Darling would never forgive us.One thing I should like to do immensely, and that is to tell her, in the wayauthors have, that the children are coming back, that indeed they will be hereon Thursday week. This would spoil so completely the surprise to which Wendyand John and Michael are looking forward. They have been planning it out on theship: mother’s rapture, father’s shout of joy, Nana’s leapthrough the air to embrace them first, when what they ought to be prepared foris a good hiding. How delicious to spoil it all by breaking the news inadvance; so that when they enter grandly Mrs. Darling may not even offer Wendyher mouth, and Mr. Darling may exclaim pettishly, “Dash it all, here arethose boys again.” However, we should get no thanks even for this. We arebeginning to know Mrs. Darling by this time, and may be sure that she wouldupbraid us for depriving the children of their little pleasure.“But, my dear madam, it is ten days till Thursday week; so that bytelling you what’s what, we can save you ten days of unhappiness.”“Yes, but at what a cost! By depriving the children of ten minutes ofdelight.”“Oh, if you look at it in that way!”“What other way is there in which to look at it?”You see, the woman had no proper spirit. I had meant to say extraordinarilynice things about her; but I despise her, and not one of them will I say now.She does not really need to be told to have things ready, for they are ready.All the beds are aired, and she never leaves the house, and observe, the windowis open. For all the use we are to her, we might well go back to the ship.However, as we are here we may as well stay and look on. That is all we are,lookers-on. Nobody really wants us. So let us watch and say jaggy things, inthe hope that some of them will hurt.The only change to be seen in the night-nursery is that between nine and sixthe kennel is no longer there. When the children flew away, Mr. Darling felt inhis bones that all the blame was his for having chained Nana up, and that fromfirst to last she had been wiser than he. Of course, as we have seen, he wasquite a simple man; indeed he might have passed for a boy again if he had beenable to take his baldness off; but he had also a noble sense of justice and alion’s courage to do what seemed right to him; and having thought thematter out with anxious care after the flight of the children, he went down onall fours and crawled into the kennel. To all Mrs. Darling’s dearinvitations to him to come out he replied sadly but firmly:“No, my own one, this is the place for me.”In the bitterness of his remorse he swore that he would never leave the kenneluntil his children came back. Of course this was a pity; but whatever Mr.Darling did he had to do in excess, otherwise he soon gave up doing it. Andthere never was a more humble man than the once proud George Darling, as he satin the kennel of an evening talking with his wife of their children and alltheir pretty ways.Very touching was his deference to Nana. He would not let her come into thekennel, but on all other matters he followed her wishes implicitly.Every morning the kennel was carried with Mr. Darling in it to a cab, whichconveyed him to his office, and he returned home in the same way at six.Something of the strength of character of the man will be seen if we rememberhow sensitive he was to the opinion of neighbours: this man whose everymovement now attracted surprised attention. Inwardly he must have sufferedtorture; but he preserved a calm exterior even when the young criticised hislittle home, and he always lifted his hat courteously to any lady who lookedinside.It may have been Quixotic, but it was magnificent. Soon the inward meaning ofit leaked out, and the great heart of the public was touched. Crowds followedthe cab, cheering it lustily; charming girls scaled it to get his autograph;interviews appeared in the better class of papers, and society invited him todinner and added, “Do come in the kennel.”On that eventful Thursday week, Mrs. Darling was in the night-nursery awaitingGeorge’s return home; a very sad-eyed woman. Now that we look at herclosely and remember the gaiety of her in the old days, all gone now justbecause she has lost her babes, I find I won’t be able to say nastythings about her after all. If she was too fond of her rubbishy children, shecouldn’t help it. Look at her in her chair, where she has fallen asleep.The corner of her mouth, where one looks first, is almost withered up. Her handmoves restlessly on her breast as if she had a pain there. Some like Peterbest, and some like Wendy best, but I like her best. Suppose, to make herhappy, we whisper to her in her sleep that the brats are coming back. They arereally within two miles of the window now, and flying strong, but all we needwhisper is that they are on the way. Let’s.It is a pity we did it, for she has started up, calling their names; and thereis no one in the room but Nana.“O Nana, I dreamt my dear ones had come back.”Nana had filmy eyes, but all she could do was put her paw gently on hermistress’s lap; and they were sitting together thus when the kennel wasbrought back. As Mr. Darling puts his head out to kiss his wife, we see thathis face is more worn than of yore, but has a softer expression.He gave his hat to Liza, who took it scornfully; for she had no imagination,and was quite incapable of understanding the motives of such a man. Outside,the crowd who had accompanied the cab home were still cheering, and he wasnaturally not unmoved.“Listen to them,” he said; “it is very gratifying.”“Lots of little boys,” sneered Liza.“There were several adults to-day,” he assured her with a faintflush; but when she tossed her head he had not a word of reproof for her.Social success had not spoilt him; it had made him sweeter. For some time hesat with his head out of the kennel, talking with Mrs. Darling of this success,and pressing her hand reassuringly when she said she hoped his head would notbe turned by it.“But if I had been a weak man,” he said. “Good heavens, if Ihad been a weak man!”“And, George,” she said timidly, “you are as full of remorseas ever, aren’t you?”“Full of remorse as ever, dearest! See my punishment: living in akennel.”“But it is punishment, isn’t it, George? You are sure you are notenjoying it?”“My love!”You may be sure she begged his pardon; and then, feeling drowsy, he curledround in the kennel.“Won’t you play me to sleep,” he asked, “on the nurserypiano?” and as she was crossing to the day-nursery he addedthoughtlessly, “And shut that window. I feel a draught.”“O George, never ask me to do that. The window must always be left openfor them, always, always.”Now it was his turn to beg her pardon; and she went into the day-nursery andplayed, and soon he was asleep; and while he slept, Wendy and John and Michaelflew into the room.Oh no. We have written it so, because that was the charming arrangement plannedby them before we left the ship; but something must have happened since then,for it is not they who have flown in, it is Peter and Tinker Bell.Peter’s first words tell all.“Quick Tink,” he whispered, “close the window; bar it!That’s right. Now you and I must get away by the door; and when Wendycomes she will think her mother has barred her out; and she will have to goback with me.”Now I understand what had hitherto puzzled me, why when Peter had exterminatedthe pirates he did not return to the island and leave Tink to escort thechildren to the mainland. This trick had been in his head all the time.Instead of feeling that he was behaving badly he danced with glee; then hepeeped into the day-nursery to see who was playing. He whispered to Tink,“It’s Wendy’s mother! She is a pretty lady, but not so prettyas my mother. Her mouth is full of thimbles, but not so full as mymother’s was.”Of course he knew nothing whatever about his mother; but he sometimes braggedabout her.He did not know the tune, which was “Home, Sweet Home,” but he knewit was saying, “Come back, Wendy, Wendy, Wendy”; and he criedexultantly, “You will never see Wendy again, lady, for the window isbarred!”He peeped in again to see why the music had stopped, and now he saw that Mrs.Darling had laid her head on the box, and that two tears were sitting on hereyes.“She wants me to unbar the window,” thought Peter, “but Iwon’t, not I!”He peeped again, and the tears were still there, or another two had taken theirplace.“She’s awfully fond of Wendy,” he said to himself. He wasangry with her now for not seeing why she could not have Wendy.The reason was so simple: “I’m fond of her too. We can’t bothhave her, lady.”But the lady would not make the best of it, and he was unhappy. He ceased tolook at her, but even then she would not let go of him. He skipped about andmade funny faces, but when he stopped it was just as if she were inside him,knocking.“Oh, all right,” he said at last, and gulped. Then he unbarred thewindow. “Come on, Tink,” he cried, with a frightful sneer at thelaws of nature; “we don’t want any silly mothers;” and heflew away.Thus Wendy and John and Michael found the window open for them after all, whichof course was more than they deserved. They alighted on the floor, quiteunashamed of themselves, and the youngest one had already forgotten his home.“John,” he said, looking around him doubtfully, “I think Ihave been here before.”“Of course you have, you silly. There is your old bed.”“So it is,” Michael said, but not with much conviction.“I say,” cried John, “the kennel!” and he dashed acrossto look into it.“Perhaps Nana is inside it,” Wendy said.But John whistled. “Hullo,” he said, “there’s a maninside it.”“It’s father!” exclaimed Wendy.“Let me see father,” Michael begged eagerly, and he took a goodlook. “He is not so big as the pirate I killed,” he said with suchfrank disappointment that I am glad Mr. Darling was asleep; it would have beensad if those had been the first words he heard his little Michael say.Wendy and John had been taken aback somewhat at finding their father in thekennel.“Surely,” said John, like one who had lost faith in his memory,“he used not to sleep in the kennel?”“John,” Wendy said falteringly, “perhaps we don’tremember the old life as well as we thought we did.”A chill fell upon them; and serve them right.“It is very careless of mother,” said that young scoundrel John,“not to be here when we come back.”It was then that Mrs. Darling began playing again.“It’s mother!” cried Wendy, peeping.“So it is!” said John.“Then are you not really our mother, Wendy?” asked Michael, who wassurely sleepy.“Oh dear!” exclaimed Wendy, with her first real twinge of remorse,“it was quite time we came back.”“Let us creep in,” John suggested, “and put our hands overher eyes.”But Wendy, who saw that they must break the joyous news more gently, had abetter plan.“Let us all slip into our beds, and be there when she comes in, just asif we had never been away.”And so when Mrs. Darling went back to the night-nursery to see if her husbandwas asleep, all the beds were occupied. The children waited for her cry of joy,but it did not come. She saw them, but she did not believe they were there. Yousee, she saw them in their beds so often in her dreams that she thought thiswas just the dream hanging around her still.She sat down in the chair by the fire, where in the old days she had nursedthem.They could not understand this, and a cold fear fell upon all the three ofthem.“Mother!” Wendy cried.“That’s Wendy,” she said, but still she was sure it was thedream.“Mother!”“That’s John,” she said.“Mother!” cried Michael. He knew her now.“That’s Michael,” she said, and she stretched out her armsfor the three little selfish children they would never envelop again. Yes, theydid, they went round Wendy and John and Michael, who had slipped out of bed andrun to her.“George, George!” she cried when she could speak; and Mr. Darlingwoke to share her bliss, and Nana came rushing in. There could not have been alovelier sight; but there was none to see it except a little boy who wasstaring in at the window. He had had ecstasies innumerable that other childrencan never know; but he was looking through the window at the one joy from whichhe must be for ever barred."

They were waiting belowto give Wendy time to explain about them; and when they had counted fivehundred they went up. They went up by the stair, because they thought thiswould make a better impression. They stood in a row in front of Mrs. Darling,with their hats off, and wishing they were not wearing their pirate clothes.They said nothing, but their eyes asked her to have them. They ought to havelooked at Mr. Darling also, but they forgot about him.Of course Mrs. Darling said at once that she would have them; but Mr. Darlingwas curiously depressed, and they saw that he considered six a rather largenumber.“I must say,” he said to Wendy, “that you don’t dothings by halves,” a grudging remark which the twins thought was pointedat them.The first twin was the proud one, and he asked, flushing, “Do you thinkwe should be too much of a handful, sir? Because, if so, we can go away.”“Father!” Wendy cried, shocked; but still the cloud was on him. Heknew he was behaving unworthily, but he could not help it.“We could lie doubled up,” said Nibs.“I always cut their hair myself,” said Wendy.“George!” Mrs. Darling exclaimed, pained to see her dear oneshowing himself in such an unfavourable light.Then he burst into tears, and the truth came out. He was as glad to have themas she was, he said, but he thought they should have asked his consent as wellas hers, instead of treating him as a cypher in his own house.“I don’t think he is a cypher,” Tootles cried instantly.“Do you think he is a cypher, Curly?”“No, I don’t. Do you think he is a cypher, Slightly?”“Rather not. Twin, what do you think?”It turned out that not one of them thought him a cypher; and he was absurdlygratified, and said he would find space for them all in the drawing-room ifthey fitted in.“We’ll fit in, sir,” they assured him.“Then follow the leader,” he cried gaily. “Mind you, I am notsure that we have a drawing-room, but we pretend we have, and it’s allthe same. Hoop la!”He went off dancing through the house, and they all cried “Hoopla!” and danced after him, searching for the drawing-room; and I forgetwhether they found it, but at any rate they found corners, and they all fittedin.As for Peter, he saw Wendy once again before he flew away. He did not exactlycome to the window, but he brushed against it in passing so that she could openit if she liked and call to him. That is what she did.“Hullo, Wendy, good-bye,” he said.“Oh dear, are you going away?”“Yes.”“You don’t feel, Peter,” she said falteringly, “thatyou would like to say anything to my parents about a very sweet subject?”“No.”“About me, Peter?”“No.”Mrs. Darling came to the window, for at present she was keeping a sharp eye onWendy. She told Peter that she had adopted all the other boys, and would liketo adopt him also.“Would you send me to school?” he inquired craftily.“Yes.”“And then to an office?”“I suppose so.”“Soon I would be a man?”“Very soon.”“I don’t want to go to school and learn solemn things,” hetold her passionately. “I don’t want to be a man. O Wendy’smother, if I was to wake up and feel there was a beard!”“Peter,” said Wendy the comforter, “I should love you in abeard;” and Mrs. Darling stretched out her arms to him, but he repulsedher.“Keep back, lady, no one is going to catch me and make me a man.”“But where are you going to live?”“With Tink in the house we built for Wendy. The fairies are to put ithigh up among the tree tops where they sleep at nights.”“How lovely,” cried Wendy so longingly that Mrs. Darling tightenedher grip.“I thought all the fairies were dead,” Mrs. Darling said.“There are always a lot of young ones,” explained Wendy, who wasnow quite an authority, “because you see when a new baby laughs for thefirst time a new fairy is born, and as there are always new babies there arealways new fairies. They live in nests on the tops of trees; and the mauve onesare boys and the white ones are girls, and the blue ones are just littlesillies who are not sure what they are.”“I shall have such fun,” said Peter, with eye on Wendy.“It will be rather lonely in the evening,” she said, “sittingby the fire.”“I shall have Tink.”“Tink can’t go a twentieth part of the way round,” shereminded him a little tartly.“Sneaky tell-tale!” Tink called out from somewhere round thecorner.“It doesn’t matter,” Peter said.“O Peter, you know it matters.”“Well, then, come with me to the little house.”“May I, mummy?”“Certainly not. I have got you home again, and I mean to keep you.”“But he does so need a mother.”“So do you, my love.”“Oh, all right,” Peter said, as if he had asked her from politenessmerely; but Mrs. Darling saw his mouth twitch, and she made this handsomeoffer: to let Wendy go to him for a week every year to do his spring cleaning.Wendy would have preferred a more permanent arrangement; and it seemed to herthat spring would be long in coming; but this promise sent Peter away quite gayagain. He had no sense of time, and was so full of adventures that all I havetold you about him is only a halfpenny-worth of them. I suppose it was becauseWendy knew this that her last words to him were these rather plaintive ones:“You won’t forget me, Peter, will you, before spring cleaning timecomes?”Of course Peter promised; and then he flew away. He took Mrs. Darling’skiss with him. The kiss that had been for no one else, Peter took quite easily.Funny. But she seemed satisfied.Of course all the boys went to school; and most of them got into Class III, butSlightly was put first into Class IV and then into Class V. Class I is the topclass. Before they had attended school a week they saw what goats they had beennot to remain on the island; but it was too late now, and soon they settleddown to being as ordinary as you or me or Jenkins minor. It is sad to have tosay that the power to fly gradually left them. At first Nana tied their feet tothe bed-posts so that they should not fly away in the night; and one of theirdiversions by day was to pretend to fall off buses; but by and by they ceasedto tug at their bonds in bed, and found that they hurt themselves when they letgo of the bus. In time they could not even fly after their hats. Want ofpractice, they called it; but what it really meant was that they no longerbelieved.Michael believed longer than the other boys, though they jeered at him; so hewas with Wendy when Peter came for her at the end of the first year. She flewaway with Peter in the frock she had woven from leaves and berries in theNeverland, and her one fear was that he might notice how short it had become;but he never noticed, he had so much to say about himself.She had looked forward to thrilling talks with him about old times, but newadventures had crowded the old ones from his mind.“Who is Captain Hook?” he asked with interest when she spoke of thearch enemy.“Don’t you remember,” she asked, amazed, “how youkilled him and saved all our lives?”“I forget them after I kill them,” he replied carelessly.When she expressed a doubtful hope that Tinker Bell would be glad to see her hesaid, “Who is Tinker Bell?”“O Peter,” she said, shocked; but even when she explained he couldnot remember.“There are such a lot of them,” he said. “I expect she is nomore.”I expect he was right, for fairies don’t live long, but they are solittle that a short time seems a good while to them.Wendy was pained too to find that the past year was but as yesterday to Peter;it had seemed such a long year of waiting to her. But he was exactly asfascinating as ever, and they had a lovely spring cleaning in the little houseon the tree tops.Next year he did not come for her. She waited in a new frock because the oldone simply would not meet; but he never came.“Perhaps he is ill,” Michael said.“You know he is never ill.”Michael came close to her and whispered, with a shiver, “Perhaps there isno such person, Wendy!” and then Wendy would have cried if Michael hadnot been crying.Peter came next spring cleaning; and the strange thing was that he never knewhe had missed a year.That was the last time the girl Wendy ever saw him. For a little longer shetried for his sake not to have growing pains; and she felt she was untrue tohim when she got a prize for general knowledge. But the years came and wentwithout bringing the careless boy; and when they met again Wendy was a marriedwoman, and Peter was no more to her than a little dust in the box in which shehad kept her toys. Wendy was grown up. You need not be sorry for her. She wasone of the kind that likes to grow up. In the end she grew up of her own freewill a day quicker than other girls.All the boys were grown up and done for by this time; so it is scarcely worthwhile saying anything more about them. You may see the twins and Nibs and Curlyany day going to an office, each carrying a little bag and an umbrella. Michaelis an engine-driver. Slightly married a lady of title, and so he became a lord.You see that judge in a wig coming out at the iron door? That used to beTootles. The bearded man who doesn’t know any story to tell his childrenwas once John.Wendy was married in white with a pink sash. It is strange to think that Peterdid not alight in the church and forbid the banns.Years rolled on again, and Wendy had a daughter. This ought not to be writtenin ink but in a golden splash.She was called Jane, and always had an odd inquiring look, as if from themoment she arrived on the mainland she wanted to ask questions. When she wasold enough to ask them they were mostly about Peter Pan. She loved to hear ofPeter, and Wendy told her all she could remember in the very nursery from whichthe famous flight had taken place. It was Jane’s nursery now, for herfather had bought it at the three per cents from Wendy’s father, who wasno longer fond of stairs. Mrs. Darling was now dead and forgotten.There were only two beds in the nursery now, Jane’s and hernurse’s; and there was no kennel, for Nana also had passed away. She diedof old age, and at the end she had been rather difficult to get on with; beingvery firmly convinced that no one knew how to look after children exceptherself.Once a week Jane’s nurse had her evening off; and then it wasWendy’s part to put Jane to bed. That was the time for stories. It wasJane’s invention to raise the sheet over her mother’s head and herown, thus making a tent, and in the awful darkness to whisper:“What do we see now?”“I don’t think I see anything to-night,” says Wendy, with afeeling that if Nana were here she would object to further conversation.“Yes, you do,” says Jane, “you see when you were a littlegirl.”“That is a long time ago, sweetheart,” says Wendy. “Ah me,how time flies!”“Does it fly,” asks the artful child, “the way you flew whenyou were a little girl?”“The way I flew? Do you know, Jane, I sometimes wonder whether I ever didreally fly.”“Yes, you did.”“The dear old days when I could fly!”“Why can’t you fly now, mother?”“Because I am grown up, dearest. When people grow up they forget theway.”“Why do they forget the way?”“Because they are no longer gay and innocent and heartless. It is onlythe gay and innocent and heartless who can fly.”“What is gay and innocent and heartless? I do wish I were gay andinnocent and heartless.”Or perhaps Wendy admits she does see something.“I do believe,” she says, “that it is this nursery.”“I do believe it is,” says Jane. “Go on.”They are now embarked on the great adventure of the night when Peter flew inlooking for his shadow.“The foolish fellow,” says Wendy, “tried to stick it on withsoap, and when he could not he cried, and that woke me, and I sewed it on forhim.”“You have missed a bit,” interrupts Jane, who now knows the storybetter than her mother. “When you saw him sitting on the floor crying,what did you say?”“I sat up in bed and I said, ‘Boy, why are youcrying?’”“Yes, that was it,” says Jane, with a big breath.“And then he flew us all away to the Neverland and the fairies and thepirates and the redskins and the mermaids’ lagoon, and the home under theground, and the little house.”“Yes! which did you like best of all?”“I think I liked the home under the ground best of all.”“Yes, so do I. What was the last thing Peter ever said to you?”“The last thing he ever said to me was, ‘Just always be waiting forme, and then some night you will hear me crowing.’”“Yes.”“But, alas, he forgot all about me,” Wendy said it with a smile.She was as grown up as that.“What did his crow sound like?” Jane asked one evening.“It was like this,” Wendy said, trying to imitate Peter’scrow.“No, it wasn’t,” Jane said gravely, “it was likethis;” and she did it ever so much better than her mother.Wendy was a little startled. “My darling, how can you know?”“I often hear it when I am sleeping,” Jane said.“Ah yes, many girls hear it when they are sleeping, but I was the onlyone who heard it awake.”“Lucky you,” said Jane.And then one night came the tragedy. It was the spring of the year, and thestory had been told for the night, and Jane was now asleep in her bed. Wendywas sitting on the floor, very close to the fire, so as to see to darn, forthere was no other light in the nursery; and while she sat darning she heard acrow. Then the window blew open as of old, and Peter dropped in on the floor.He was exactly the same as ever, and Wendy saw at once that he still had allhis first teeth.He was a little boy, and she was grown up. She huddled by the fire not daringto move, helpless and guilty, a big woman.“Hullo, Wendy,” he said, not noticing any difference, for he wasthinking chiefly of himself; and in the dim light her white dress might havebeen the nightgown in which he had seen her first.“Hullo, Peter,” she replied faintly, squeezing herself as small aspossible. Something inside her was crying “Woman, Woman, let go ofme.”“Hullo, where is John?” he asked, suddenly missing the third bed.“John is not here now,” she gasped.“Is Michael asleep?” he asked, with a careless glance at Jane.“Yes,” she answered; and now she felt that she was untrue to Janeas well as to Peter.“That is not Michael,” she said quickly, lest a judgment shouldfall on her.Peter looked. “Hullo, is it a new one?”“Yes.”“Boy or girl?”“Girl.”Now surely he would understand; but not a bit of it.“Peter,” she said, faltering, “are you expecting me to flyaway with you?”“Of course; that is why I have come.” He added a little sternly,“Have you forgotten that this is spring cleaning time?”She knew it was useless to say that he had let many spring cleaning times pass.“I can’t come,” she said apologetically, “I haveforgotten how to fly.”“I’ll soon teach you again.”“O Peter, don’t waste the fairy dust on me.”She had risen; and now at last a fear assailed him. “What is it?”he cried, shrinking.“I will turn up the light,” she said, “and then you can seefor yourself.”For almost the only time in his life that I know of, Peter was afraid.“Don’t turn up the light,” he cried.She let her hands play in the hair of the tragic boy. She was not a little girlheart-broken about him; she was a grown woman smiling at it all, but they werewet-eyed smiles.Then she turned up the light, and Peter saw. He gave a cry of pain; and whenthe tall beautiful creature stooped to lift him in her arms he drew backsharply.“What is it?” he cried again.She had to tell him.“I am old, Peter. I am ever so much more than twenty. I grew up longago.”“You promised not to!”“I couldn’t help it. I am a married woman, Peter.”“No, you’re not.”“Yes, and the little girl in the bed is my baby.”“No, she’s not.”But he supposed she was; and he took a step towards the sleeping child with hisdagger upraised. Of course he did not strike. He sat down on the floor insteadand sobbed; and Wendy did not know how to comfort him, though she could havedone it so easily once. She was only a woman now, and she ran out of the roomto try to think.Peter continued to cry, and soon his sobs woke Jane. She sat up in bed, and wasinterested at once.“Boy,” she said, “why are you crying?”Peter rose and bowed to her, and she bowed to him from the bed.“Hullo,” he said.“Hullo,” said Jane.“My name is Peter Pan,” he told her.“Yes, I know.”“I came back for my mother,” he explained, “to take her tothe Neverland.”“Yes, I know,” Jane said, “I have been waiting foryou.”When Wendy returned diffidently she found Peter sitting on the bed-post crowinggloriously, while Jane in her nighty was flying round the room in solemnecstasy.“She is my mother,” Peter explained; and Jane descended and stoodby his side, with the look in her face that he liked to see on ladies when theygazed at him.“He does so need a mother,” Jane said.“Yes, I know,” Wendy admitted rather forlornly; “no one knowsit so well as I.”“Good-bye,” said Peter to Wendy; and he rose in the air, and theshameless Jane rose with him; it was already her easiest way of moving about.Wendy rushed to the window.“No, no,” she cried.“It is just for spring cleaning time,” Jane said, “he wantsme always to do his spring cleaning.”“If only I could go with you,” Wendy sighed.“You see you can’t fly,” said Jane.Of course in the end Wendy let them fly away together. Our last glimpse of hershows her at the window, watching them receding into the sky until they were assmall as stars.As you look at Wendy, you may see her hair becoming white, and her figurelittle again, for all this happened long ago. Jane is now a common grown-up,with a daughter called Margaret; and every spring cleaning time, except when heforgets, Peter comes for Margaret and takes her to the Neverland, where shetells him stories about himself, to which he listens eagerly. When Margaretgrows up she will have a daughter, who is to be Peter’s mother in turn;and thus it will go on, so long as children are gay and innocent and heartless.THE END"
